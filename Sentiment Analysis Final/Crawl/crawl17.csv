I wore it over a back-turned ball cap and it was very comfortable and stable. The footage looks great and it freed my hands to climb. A word of caution is to make sure you test the angle of the camera. I aimed it at my eyesight range and the vista footage POV came out a bit too high but because it was a vertical scramble, it caught the route perfectly. So, just make sure you adjust the angle of the camera on the mount lower than you think and/or move your head more extreme to capture footage lower down. Other than that I recommend this product.",65 people found this helpful,Yes

Price and Quality are excellent.,I had to make some video of laboratory operations for my work. In the limited time I had I wasn't able to set up a GoPro on a tripod for all the angles I needed. The next best way would be to use a camera on my head angled to show what my hands were doing. But how to strap a camera to my head? Amazon provides.This is a head harness equipped with fixtures to mount a GoPro to the harness. It is well made and adjustable for for all sizes. The mount is well made and fits the connections of a GoPro very well. The mount allows you to angle the camera through 90 degrees.The only downsid that I encountered after wearing this for 90 minutes was the big re-imprint of mounting plate I had on my forehead. If you have to strap a camera to your head then maybe wearing a woolly hat (welders beanie?) underneath the harness.The price and quality are right and if you have to strap a camera to your head this is a good way to go.,18 people found this helpful,Yes

Will not secure the camera to the headband if you think it has engaged and then falls out. Amazon sent a second unit but it has the same issue.

The only downside of head straps in general is that you can't see the angle of view to make sure the shot is perfect (unless you have a buddy to help you).RECOMMENDATION - One thing to keep in mind if you're planning to use this for hiking: when you're hiking on steep terrain, most of the time you're head will be down looking at the ground / at your footwork. In other words, the camera may be looking at the ground more often than your surroundings. It may sound obvious but just keep your activity in mind when wearing this in order to adjust the GoPro angle accordingly.

I put my headband to the test yesterday while taking my kids snow sledding using my CamPark V40. The straps are made of quality elastic and is a solid product. The harness and action cam did pop off my head a couple times, BUT.... I was cruising at breakneck speed down a steep icy hill on a snow sled and launched a good 15 feet and the harness popped off upon impacting the ground. That being said.... the straps are not made of steel or leather, they are elastic... a good elastic, but nevertheless.... you'll need to understand that the harness is made for action scenarios with movement and whatnot... but there is definitely a breaking point with regards to how much action the headband can take.... .I will say that the headband never detached from my action cam when it popped off my head, so the attachment pieces worked wonderfully, I just don't think I wrenched the head harness down hard enough for the physical nature of what I was doing. I give this 5 stars even though it came off my head, but that was really my fault... I should have used a helmet to attach the action cam due to the extreme physical abuse my body took while careening uncontrollably down that icy hill. It's a good product. It is well built, good materials, easy to install the cam and it was comfortable. I would definitely recommend!",N/A,Yes
