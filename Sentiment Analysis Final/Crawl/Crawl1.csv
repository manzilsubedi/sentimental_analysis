You haven't been scammed if you don't find the wired headphones  in the box!Original review: I say it's the best, with a grain of salt, read the cons to know why!To start off, Samsung did an amazing job with this phone, so much that they rendered the fairly new, still very expensive, S20 Ultra, almost obsolete!But I'm not gonna review both units here, so for those of you looking for quick pros & cons, here you go.Pros:- AMAZING display, I had so many high end phones, including the IPhone 11 pro max and Google Pixel 4XL & even the note 10, but this screen here bests all of them. The high refresh rate, the beautiful colors, and the better ratio (it's a little wider than the S20 ultra for example), all this makes for an outstanding screen.- Great main camera. The pictures are just perfect in almost all light conditions. I dunno how much better is the 108 MP mode, it bothered me a little that cropping a 108 MP picture didn't yield the perfect result, but all in all, the camera is top notch, in all its modes. The videos are even better. You won't find a phone with a better main camera on the market.- The S pen is pretty useful for taking notes! I didn't feel like I needed it for anything else except, may be, for a selfie, so eventhough it isn't the biggest selling point, it's worth mentioning.- It looks great! Yup, design wise, that phone looks really good, that it feels bad putting any covers on it. I personally just ordered a very slim, transparent case & I wouldn't recommend anything else.There are some added gimmicky features that you can find almost everywhere online, but I personally loved the direct share, where I can show anything I want from my phone and cast it to a smart TV or one with a Google chrome cast attached to it, it happened a lot before that I needed to show many people at the same time, whatever it is that was on my phone, photos or a certain app, and that feature here makes it so easy.Cons:- I dunno how this isn't mentioned anywhere, but the selfie camera isn't great at all in low light conditions. Yes in the morning, outdoor, it is very good, but other than that it's just not great! I could see myself buying the next Google Pixel instead, just for this.- Battery life isn't good enough either. It's worse than my S20 Ultra, and it was no surprise, since Samsung decided to give this phone a smaller battery 🙄I find myself charging it twice a day, which really isn't practical.Just for those 2 points, added to the fact that it's a super expensive phone, I had to give it 4 stars.Now if it gets the Google Pixel software for the selfie camera, and a full day of battery life that would have been the best phone ever made! But I guess we'll have to wait for next year for that!",564 people found this helpful,No

I decided to give the Note a try as it seemed that it would keep up with my daily usage for work and I've always desired having the S pen.I've been using this phone for a few days now and it is soooooo slow. Apps and Google searches take way too long to load. Hotspot is just downright awful. Battery life is sub par. Fast charging is much slower than what I had. Camera doesn't quite compare to my old phone's Leica camera, which I figured it wouldn't. Not sure what kind of scam this is but I'm definitely returning it. Also didn't come with earbuds or the phone clone connector. Don't get me wrong, the phone looks great. The S pen was everything I was hoping for. The screen is spectacular and super bright. The 120hz refresh rate was cool for maybe the first 10 sec, then I realized it was a pretty worthless feature. Scrolling to the end of long page in a few seconds does me no good when I'm trying to read posts or search for information on that page.I went to AT&T to get my phone diagnosed. He tested it against his Note 20 Ultra and his phone ended up being twice as fast as mine running the same speed test, on the same network, on the same unlimited plan... all after my device took an additional 10-15 sec to connect before even starting the test.My advice, don't waste your money. Just because Samsung markets like crazy doesn't mean their phones are any good. For a flagship device and the price point, this phone falls well short of being worth it. I came from a two year old Huawei Mate 20 Pro and it's sad that Samsung can't make a phone that is able to compete with it. Not what I expected for my first Note phone. I've never been a Samsung hater by any means, but this experience just solidifies my previous viewpoint to never buy a Samsung device. Won't make that mistake again.Update:I made that mistake again... In my defense, I was hoping this was an isolated incident or just a simple case of a bad device. I ordered another unlocked Note 20 Ultra from Best Busy to compare. Unfortunately for me, it was not. That device had all the same issues. Slow network speeds with AT&T (I live in a major city so this shouldn't happen, period). This phone also didn't come with earbuds so it seems like Samsung is just getting cheap on consumers.I tried swapping the SIM card with my girlfriend's S20 and it still didn't work. All calls were sent directly to voicemail and text messages were very hit or miss. AT&T had no idea, but I'm sure it was out of the hourly employees realm to troubleshoot. I had to switch back to my Huawei Mate 20 Pro. After 10 min or so I got a couple delayed text messages that were sent days ago in response to a text I originally sent from the Note 20 Ultra. SMH...I'm just downright confused at this point. Not sure whether it's an issue with the device or with the 5G network, or both. You also can't change which network bands you want to use, ie. turn 5G off. You can only toggle 2G on and off. My buddy has full control with his Note 10+ which is really mind boggling. Either way, both phones have been returned.I'm self-employed and my phone is my lifeline. I don't have time to play these games or wait for Samsung to release an update. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this phone and I loved the S pen so far. Samsung just has a history of not being able to meet my expectations. The even bigger shame is that I can't upgrade to better Huawei device...",288 people found this helpful,Yes

   I got this on launch day and it had a defect where the S pen wasn't registering in a large circular area on the screen. Amazon sent me a replacement and it had the exact same failure. I'm done with it. I've had 2 other notes in the past and loved them, but having this almost $1500 phone fail right out of the box is where my love of the Note ends.IMPORTANT EDIT:  I Noticed this same issue occurring with my Note 10+ after I returned this phone (twice). This phenomenon was being caused by a Steelie magnetic mount on the back of the case. So if you are using a magnetic mount or have the phone close to a magnetic field, you will encounter this exact same issue.I have changed the review score to reflect this new information.",279 people found this helpful,Yes

   Please, do not buy your $1,300 phone on Amazon! Buy it from somewhere legit or some where you can be sure that you get what you deserve. Like Samsung Store or bestbuy. You might have to spend extra bucks, but it's more worth it!I purchased ""New"" (not ""Used"" Amazon!) Samsung Note 20 Ultra 512 GB for $1,099 and I thought it was a good deal, but I was wrong.I recieved my Note 20 Ultra 512GB today, and I was so upset to unbox this package. My first impression with this phone was so bad. The box of phone was not sealed with the plastic wrap like the new phone should have. Instead, it was sealed with the two circle stickers(one on the top left and one on the bottom right. The sign of ""Note20 Ultra 5G"" was weirdly printed. You can see from the picture that it is a little crooked. Upon further inspection, I suspect that this package might have been opened before because of the stickers seal and noises when I shaked the box, and I was right. I found a bunch of fingerprints and a pen sticking out. I popped the s-pen back in, and tried to shake the phone, and you can here that something is loosen in the video. I am not sure if this phone suppose to have this sound, but it is so unpleasant to hear and it makes this phone cheap. I spent $1000+ on this phone and I didn't expect any of these.This is not the first time Amazon turned me down. It is my fault for trusting Amazon when I know I shouldn't especially when it comes to big purchases like this. Now I learned that I might be better off with the manufacturer website if I want to purchase something like this. Buyers!!! Please, be ware!",169 people found this helpful,Yes

This phone will probably hold the crown for best Android phone for a good while, and it has key feature bumps that made me especially want this phone--namely the 5G and the 120 Hz screen.I would definitely recommend a solid case if you're planning to spend this much money on a phone. I bought a Spigen case which effectively reduces the camera bump on the back to allow the phone to sit flat on a desk. The IP68 rating means that it will be fine with water and dust, but drop protection is still a must. I saw a stat recently that something like 2/3 of people report incurring drop damage to their phone (for all phones not specifically this phone).Other thoughts: I think it's interesting that most middle class people can afford the best phone that you can possibly purchase for a product that is in your pocket, everyday, all the time. You can't say that about cars, houses, clothes, but you could definitely swing buying the best phone that money can buy once every 3-4 years if it's important enough to you. For me it is, and I'm very happy with this phone.Lastly: Google Pixel, 1+, Apple, etc. can only hope to match some of the features that this phone has to offer, but I highly doubt that they will exceed this phone's specs on yet to be release products. Just my opinion as a phone guy, but the best that they could hope to do is give you a better value on specific features. If you're somebody looking for the best value on a calling and texting machine, then this phone is not for you. This phone is for somebody that wants the best cameras, pocket computing power, & screen quality that money can buy you right now.",105 people found this helpful,Yes

Yep, it seems to be a widespread issue in the Note 20 Ultra.Adjusting the Green slider all the way down didn't completely eliminate the issue. White balance was more neutral, but flesh tones were horrendous when watching movies.I was going to return the phone it was so off-putting, but I found a better workaround.There is an accessibility feature apparently meant for people who have difficulty seeing color accurately due to some physical impairment. This feature also happens to work for a phone/panel combo that cannot display color accurately as well.Go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Visibility Enhancements ->Color Adjustment ->Personalized Color.There will be a circle and a bunch of dots of various colors. You pick the color that appears nearest to the tint of the prior color in the circle. Repeat for all the dots. When you are done with all of the dots, the device will calibrate the screen accordingly, and the results are a huge improvement.This is also excellent for people who have cataracts or who have artificial intraocular lenses, as both of those things affect the color balance you perceive, and this feature compensates for both your eyes and the phone's display inaccuracies.Battery life doesn't seem to be as good as advertised. it drops at a rate that seems similar to my 3 year old Galaxy S8, and the S8 still has the original battery.Camera is much improved, stereo sound from onboard speakers is very good.",7 people found this helpful,Yes
