This little book is perfect in almost every way.In general, this Chromebook is perfect for what I bought it for: work-related tasks on the web, surfing the web, using Google Docs to type up documents & write lyrics for songs, and organizing thoughts and ideas into productivity apps and jotting down tasks in my Microsoft To-Do list app.  This Chromebook is lightning fast in powering up, connecting to WiFi & Bluetooth, and opening apps & browsers.The Screen size is non-jeopardizing; large enough for a functional workspace, but small enough to easily store away in a backpack. Bezels are a lot smaller than most budget Chromebooks; I honestly prefer a little bezel to grab the screen without the mouse thinking you're trying to press something.The keyboard is unbelievable. Typing is extremely fast and responsive. Perfectly spaced keys. It's quiet, and has just the right amount of click so you know when you typed a letter. It's back-lit, but dims off when not in use. You will have to change the search key to caps lock in the settings, if that is something you're used to.The mouse is very responsive as well. I have purchased a Logitech Pebble in black which matches perfectly; it also pairs up via Bluetooth, so you don't have to have a USB receiver sticking out of the side of your Chromebook!The battery life so far is all-day. I think we all know how nice it is to open a Chromebook/Laptop and still have most of the juice in it. One of my favorite things about Chromebooks, including this one, is having a USB-C charging port on EITHER side of the device; therefore, if there is an outlet closer to you on one side, you can connect to that side.The price is unreal; $409 for a 10th gen i3, this thing is just as fast if not faster than older gen i5 and i7 computers. RAM hasn't been an issue, nor 64 GB memory. I store all of my documents on Google Drive, so storage is not an issue. Additionally, there is a microSD port on the side, but I decided not to use it since the SD card isn't completely flush.Last BUT NOT LEAST, this thing is sleek and elegant. This is THE nicest looking Chrombook in the low-budget range. The charcoal/dark grey is beautiful and modern. The keys, hinges, screen, and logos are minimal and pleasing. The use of space is perfect; the speakers are on either side of the keyboard. No space is wasted in this Chromebook. The screen has a nice glossy shimmer.There is only ONE con to this amazing machine, and it is a minor one: opening the screen. Unlike the Pixelbook Go, this Chromebook takes two hands to open. There no cut-out on the screen lid, so it can sometimes be tricky to open, especially since the device is very thin. Like I said, this is not only minor, but it is the ONLY issue I have come across.Overall, I can hands down recommend this device over all other Chromebooks. This is THE ONE.  Affordable, practical, and exquisite. Well done Lenovo. Thank you for saving me money in a time like this.",282 people found this helpful,Yes

The issues I was facing was from my own doing. I forgot that I had set the OS to dev mode sometime ago and that was causing the device to act up. After setting the OS back to standard mode, it is running smoothly not freezing once.  All our headache went away.  Back to 5 stars!Revised - 9/24/20Stay AWAY!! Now the sound is going away during my daughter's virtual class.  We need to restart the device in order to get the sound back.  I would stay away from this device if you need something for school.  Our first Chromebook so not sure if this is normal for Chromebook.  Very dissapointed to say the least.Revised - 9/23/20Our device is starting to freeze daily and needing restart.  This is extremely frustrating for my 4th grade daughter when learning virtually.  It is not like she has too many files or apps open so I'm down grading this to three stars.With our kids needing more time on computer for their schoolwork during the COVID19, we finally decided to purchase a chromebook.  What I wanted was a unit with 14"" monitor, FHD, at least 4GB Ram, at least 64GB storage, a decent processor, and touchscreen.  That got my attention on Asus Flip 434 and HP X360 but perhaps due to the dwindling inventories, I was not finding any attractive deals for these or any of the mid range chromebooks in the weeks studying the market.And then I came across the soon to be released Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 with all but one of the spec I was looking for; it has a 13.3"" monitor.  But at $409, I could deal with the slightly less monitor size so I preordered a unit.The product came 1 day early and we had it for close to a week now.  The build quality is solid with quality feel throughout. One exception is the edge along the trackpad at the very side of the unit.  When flipping the laptop to a tablet, I noticed the edge plastic along the trackpad move slightly since it is thin. We'll see if it can withstand the usage by our kids.  But that is the only concern I have.The display is very crisp with wide viewing angle.  I like the keystrokes on the keyboard.  It zips through any of the activities we do granted we are using mostly for web browsing and video conferencing. The only game my kids tried was Roblox since their 3 year old tablet is having hard time playing it.  The Flex 5 plays it very smoothly.For me, this is my first Chromebook experience so I'm still getting used to the little differences from the PC/Windows but it's not that difficult.  It's no different then when a new version Windows is released.I am very pleased with the purchase and hope one unit will be enough for the four of us：）",121 people found this helpful,Yes

Today's date is 7/7.  Upon setting up my chromebook I was disappointed by the clarity (hazy) and washed out colors on the screen.  I began this morning by  searching for an online tech support email,  chat, or phone number for Lenovo.  Please dont waste your time by clicking on Contact Us"".  It will take you around in circles.  I started feeling that I had  made a big mistake by purchasing a laptop on line rather than physically going into Best Buy. After several try's, I called Amazon.  Leo, Amazon tech support tried to  help me upload drivers because the resolution was only 1568 x 874.  After several attempted he called Lenovo tech support.  I'm sure he got through because he was Amazon.  The hardware tech support person was  also unable to help me change the resolution.  By now I had been on the phone for an hour.  The hardware support person bow transferred me to  Lenovo software support.  When that person picked up I heard Leo, from Amazon explain all my difficulties.  The software  support person told Leo  that  due to the warranty, there would be a charge!  Hw saidss, what, she just purchased this laptop.  Leo thanked the person and said we would not need anything further.  Then Leo  said lets try one more thing.  OK that one more thing did resolve my problem.  The only issue I have no is  that with resetting the resolution,  the font size was greatly reduced.  When making the adjustment to Appearance in Settings, it  did enlarge  the font size in some areas but not all which is perplexing??  I  thanked Leo and said, I  hope  I  never need Lenovo  for support!!!  I have never written  a bad review but felt it was necessary to  let ogthers know  what to expect withLenovo.  Let me add  that Leo, Amazon told me  he would  be reporting this experience.  So my guess is  that probably does not bode well for Lenovo!",37 people found this helpful,Yes

I read tons of reviews before making the purchase and watched every single Youtube video reviewing it. After a couple of days of usage, this are the things I like and dislike the most about this device.What I like:- You can get that premium feel right out of the box. Given the price tag, one wouldn't expect this, but it feels amazing. The chassis is metal on top (maybe aluminium?) and plastic on the bottom part. All fells solid, even the hinge. I absolutely agree with other reviews.- Comfortable keyboard. It's easy to write on it, the keys have a long travel and feel solid enough. Many reviews spend some time explaining this, and the laptop didn't let me down.- Crisp screen with relatively small bezels (less than 1/2¨).- Great performance. I was worried about the 4 GB ram and not a possibility to expand it. However, I've had no issues, even with 8-10 tabs open in chrome and two Youtube videos in parallel. That i3 together with chrome OS does an amazing job.- USB-C charging port on either side.What I dislike:- The touchpad is okay. Is not a bad touchpad and its quite big, but compared with any Macbook you feel the difference. I'm getting used to it but it doesn't feel as responsive as I want it to be.- The camera is average. Compared with the 2014 MBA's camera, its crappy.- The screen is very shiny. Watching videos with a light in the background will definitely bother you. Using it outside will make it even worse.- Its heavy to be used in tablet mode. So, in my opinion, the touch screen is not necessary at all.- I can hear a high pitched, very faint noise on the back of the laptop. I don't know if this is the processor or the fan or what, but in a quiet room I find it annoying. Some other reviews also mentioned this issue.Overall, I don't regret my purchase. Everything feels snappy, and I'm pleased with the looks of this laptop every time I use it.-------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE July 20:- I'm taking out 10+ hours out of the battery when using it lightly (docs, surfing the web, etc).- I'm confirming that you can charge the device from the USB-C port on either side.- Feels snappy always: takes less than 10 seconds to boot, chrome opens instantly (literally, less than half a second).- The biggest flaw I found is the reflection of external light on the screen. It bothers me every time I'm watching a dark scene in Netflix. I can perfectly see my face, similar to the reflection on my phone's black screen.",24 people found this helpful,Yes

What has been frustrating is that on the second day of use I noticed that the inside half of the right hand hinge is not connected to the screen or keyboard sections, and I have been unable to figure out from Lenovo service if this is a problem that should get addressed, or was intentional, by design.  I submitted a ticked, got a vague computer generated response, so I chatted with a representative that told me that it was an intentional design--but two days after that received an email with instructions to send it in, and the person that I chatted with then told me to send it in to be checked in case there was a problem.In short, either it is a well designed and well functioning machine for which I would give 5 stars, or, they have initial manufacturing problems.

The power button is flush with the device which made turning it on confusing.

This is a very nice laptop in that the keys are back lit (unlike my previous Chromebook - Asus C300), I believe the updates for this one runs until 2028 and I love the Powerwash feature that allows you to restore it to factory settings and once signed in via your Google account it restores everything as it was.

If you are looking for something a grade above what school's pay almost nothing for but don't want to spend a fortune on an overpowered web-browser (cough cough Pixelbook), I would 100% recommend this device.I have only had the device about a week, but am thus far very impressed for the following reasons:- When I first unboxed the device, I was immediately struck by the build quality. Everything felt solid well built. There was almost no flex in the screen or chassis and the hinge is firm enough to not wobble when touched but also loose enough to flex into any position easily.- The screen is plenty bright. It's not the brightest panel out there, but it worked outdoors for me, especially in the shade. Thin top and side bezels also complement the panel nicely; the pictures don't do it justice. Aesthetically this is a nice, modern-looking device (aside for the old-school 16:9 aspect ratio, but I find putting the taskbar on the right side is a simple yet effective workaround for this; I do this on my Dell as well).- The keyboard is incredible. It's incredibly responsive and tactile. I know exactly when a key has been hit and recorded, and am left satisfied after every keystroke with no doubts and a nice clicky sound. I almost look forward to writing my first essay on this machine. Also, the backlight is very nice. It's one of those features I forgot about but was happy to find when I turned the computer on.- Performance is fantastic. The i3 and 4gb of memory have me doing whatever I want whenever I want. I've never seen any slowdowns except for using beta Linux programs (like Firefox).About what I expected was touchpad size. It's not as big as you'll find on a Macbook for instance but it's definitely no slouch. My 15"" Dell Precision Workstation has a smaller trackpad. The pad works well, avoid fingerprints and smudges, and is comfortably sized for any stroke (I've never accidentally slid my finger off the pad).Battery life is also (so far) about as expected. I have never taken it close to all the way down, but as my secondary machine the device does not get nearly the usage as my Dell to test the battery. What I can say is that I have never had concern picking up the device for an hour or so regardless of if I charged it overnight or not. Plus, charging via USB C on either side makes the device easy to charge regardless of what I'm doing or where I've put the laptop down.Also on the bottom side of acceptable is the camera. It works. The color is good but sharpness and expsure are terrible. Given the compression of video calls, however, these shouldn't be a big deal. Plus, the physical shutter is nice to have for peace of mind without an ugly post it or piece of tape gunking up the lens. It's a typical crappy webcam.The only thing I expected to be nicer are the speakers. I am a bit of an audiophile (though not nearly to the degree of many self-proclaimed audiophiles), and seeing the large speaker grills in the photos prompted me to expect larger drivers than the device has. Upon testing the speakers, they sound small (even at lower volumes), and with the device in hand you can see that the speakers only exist in about the bottom quarter of the speaker grill - yikes. They get the job done.All in all, this is a very solid device. I have no regrets with my purchase. If you are looking for a good laptop to access the internet on and run some basic software (mainly android apps and PWAs), you should have no issues or complaints.",11 people found this helpful,Yes

The screen hinge is captured by a small plastic piece on the bottom. I assume the hinge was too tight and the ""stress"" from closing the screen broke the glued plastic hinge retainer. Therefore the frame flexed and cracked the screen just above the hinge.Called Lenovo tech support, on hold forever, and gave them model number and told them it was a Chromebook. They needed more device info so they asked me to press the windows key and run a command! LOL! So I stated again this was a Chromebook and not a windows laptop. At that point they said need to take to repair center.Drove 40 miles to repair center and got a call a week later that because there was physical damage, no matter the cause, Lenovo would not honor any warranty repair. Repair tech also said there are no parts in stock from Lenovo to even fix device and if they were in stock would be $600 to fix a $400 dollar device.So this is just an FYI for people, I would get the extended warranty or be prepared to dispose of the device. Because if it breaks no parts, no warranty, and certainly no help from Lenovo.Wanted to post an update:Just picked device from repair center. As others have said if you look closely at the right hinge, there is no pin/support on the inside part of the hinge. The left hinge as a pin on both sides. I have two of these and confirmed that both are designed the same. This puts stress on that area when closing the device and will eventually fail. Repair center can't even get parts because Lenovo won't supply them until device is out of warranty from initial release date. So left to deal with Lenovo for a $400 Chromebook. Not worth my time. Just sorry Amazon is selling this on prime account and won't issue a refund or replacement.",8 people found this helpful,Yes
