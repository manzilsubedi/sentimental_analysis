Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.",310 people found this helpful,Yes

Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review",128 people found this helpful,Yes

Anyone giving it a poor review for that is misinformed.This phone seemed to be a better fit than a newer Pixel, but I was concerned with camera quality. The photos I've taken look really great and the camera app is very similar to the others I've used. I've taken several hundred pics since owning the phone and they have turned out almost as good (in some cases even better) than the ones taken with my Pixel 2 XL.I've installed all of my apps and been using it heavily and it gets significantly better battery life than my other phones. This was a big complaint and one of my primary reasons to upgrade. The screen on the 8 is really bright in Auto and adjusts well to surrounding light. Leaving the phone to adjust automatically has been fine most of the time and I rarely change it myself.The Warp Charging is absolutely amazing. Plugging it in for a short amount of time charges the battery up enough to use for hours. This wasn't really a huge selling point for me, but it did make me quite happy when I used it.The build quality and looks are impressive too. It just feels like a premium phone. The Interstellar Glow is an interesting color choice and it looks sogood in person. Any clear case will show off it's iridescent shine.Software has been a big win here. The simplicity of stock Android has always been appealing to me and getting away from that has been hard. You don't realize how much you were missing until you start using something like Oxygen OS on a OnePlus phone. You can change the icons on the entire phone with icon packs downloaded from Play Store. You can change the status bar, system icons, the color and shapes. So many things can be customized and it is so smooth.I was worried that I would spend the money to be let down, but this has been a great purchase.

Don't worry about Alexa, your wife won't see her.","Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting.

It may not have the name recognition in the USA that some of the other well-known brands do (Apple, Samsung, LG, Motorola, etc.) but now that more carriers are starting to adopt the brand in the states (Verizon & T-Mobile) it’s only a matter of time before it’s mentioned in the same breath as the Iphone or a galaxy. It has already topped many of the best phones of 2020 lists and for good reason. This phone is a beast, plain and simple. Whatever you throw at it, it can handle it plus more. Navigation in buttery smooth with a 90hz refresh rate screen. It’s got all the hardware you want under the hood with the latest Snapdragon processor on the market, 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage in the model I went with. It runs Android 10 with OxygenOS 10 UI which has always been good about giving the user great performance without shoving bloatware down your throat (it’s there but not in your face) They went away from the notch on the 6 and moved to a hole punch selfie camera on the 8 which really opens up the screen space.  The rear cameras are high-powered topping out at 48MP and takes superb pictures and videos. The 4300 mAh battery has already lasted me a complete day and some change including a twelve-hour shift at work as an IT professional when I’m constantly using my phone to perform tasks. The warp charger is insanely fast as I can go to empty to a full charge in about 45 minutes. What it lacks, I don’t miss. The headphone jack is no more from the 6 but most all phones have said goodbye to that relic from yesteryear. I don’t want to pay a premium for an IP68 rating (just get a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle case and thank me later) nor do I care about wireless charging. If those things are important to you, pay the extra $100-200 and upgrade to the OnePlus 8 Pro. While the phone is 5g capable, unless you’re on T-Mobile, you will likely only see 4G LTE if you’re like me (AT&T) since the device is ahead of the carriers in terms of coverage and compatibility. The best Android experience around all at an affordable price point in the top tier of flagship devices. This is the smartphone you want.

This phone is clearly faster, but the best part is the smooth scrolling. Screen looks good, and I tend to trust displaymate. The finger print reader is instant so far. I noticed the sound of this phone has better base than s9 plus, voice of YouTuber sounded better on speaker. As a Samsung lover, I've been wondering what features I may miss. So far just occasionally checking on Samsung what time I fell asleep. For a moment, I recall thinking, Atmos, I doubt one plus covered that base. But they did.The gs9 + is lighter, and a bit shorter, and I can tell it feels better when limited to one hand. The galaxy s20+, my other consideration, is even lighter than the s9 plus. I think this is the main disadvantage to me, but so far I'm excited to give a new oem a chance. I think one plus checked so many boxes it was a compelling choice. I'll try to update if I regret switching oems, which I usually do when I try anything else.",8 people found this helpful,Yes

I grow more fond of it every day. I highly recommend setting up and doing a software update first thing. I am coming from a Pixel 2 XL. One of the big things for me was the camera. The OnePlus takes extremely good pictures and videos. Played around with the slow-mo option and it was pretty cool. The regular photos have slightly more exposure than my Pixel, but they are very crisp and clean. I imagine the camera and its features will only get better with future software updates. The phone itself is great. The features and flow of its Oxygen OS is phenomenal. My girlfriend got a Note 20 Ultra at the same time, and the layout and user-friendliness of the OnePlus seems better to me. On that note, the photos are almost identical on her phone and the OnePlus. I have spent some time playing around with the phone, watched videos, and read about features of the OnePlus, and there are a lot of ways to customize this phone. The fingerprint reader works well, however I did have to delete one of my thumb imprints a couple times for it to really work well. I've got both thumbs and a finger on file and they all work well now. There really are a lot of cool features with the phone that would be too much to list here. Youtube ""Tips and tricks for OnePlus 8 Pro"" and it'll pull up lots of stuff. The phone comes with a screen protector already installed, so that was a bonus. It smudges somewhat easily, but probably no more than any other screen proctector.I would buy this phone again in a heartbeat. It's really cool and has lot of customizations and really cool little features that make it awesome. I'll updated this review as things come up, good or bad.UPDATE, 9-15-20: Still loving it.",7 people found this helpful,Yes

Others have summarized the good points so I am going to focus on the bad:1.  Despite false advertising, this phone is not dual SIM in the USA at least.  An update has been promised since April ""next update"" but every update it is the same, no dual SIM.2.  The curved edge is critical to control this phone - scrolling, back and forward, etc.  Very cool and it works great except that it is impossible to hold the phone securely without activating the edge controls.  This means you have to hold the phone in the palm of your hand without touching the sides - not an easy trick and it makes it easy to drop the phone.3.  Because of the edge control issue, cases are poorly made for this phone.  I have tried three including the official OnePlus case, and all have the same issue - the edge protector ridge interferes with the swiping needed for edge control functions.4.  We have a documented issue where messages SMS that messages that are actually sent show up as unsent.  This problem reappears from time to time and OnePlus tech supports only answer is to totally reset the phone from firmware boot ROM (losing all apps and app data).  I just ignore the "" message not sent"" errors now but that is unacceptable in a flagship.4. Battery life is really so so.  I got a lot more life on my Moto z4.  Maybe the issue is the impressive 120hz display which looks amazing.  But battery life is just too short... In heavy use it doesn't last more than 6-7 hours.  Again, not bad for a mid-range but a flagship must do better.",8 people found this helpful,Yes

I gotta say this phone is so lovely to use. It's hundreds less than s20+ and yet it is much better in my opinion. Cleaner ui close to stock Android with neat customizations. The display color accuracy is superb, I love how I can enable qhd and 120hz all while getting a good battery life with brightness at 75%. I use the phone daily throughout the day to web browse, watch YouTube, text, stream from Netflix Hulu etc, music with bluetooth, wifi mostly on all day and it's solid.Next the build is very excellent and that's how it should be for 1000 dollars.The cameras, the main sensor is super crisp, the wide angle is also quite sharp, and same goes for telephoto, the macro photography is actually super insane in this phone. It focuses so quickly across all cameras, the colors are super vivid and bright with nice contrast and I love how I can get insanely close to a subject and it still focuses without issues at all. Now I never really used much of the 30x zoom but it seems good and it can be useful to see things from far away. The selfie camera is good but I don't really care for the face smoothing. The overall camera quality is so good like for sure flagship level.The face unlock, fingerprint scanner are super quick and reliable. Works all the time. All the amazing features listed are so sick and work all the time! This phone is a beast. It's a phone that just works so I don't feel like I need to say much more.Now the only issue with this phone is the display. After just a day of use I started seeing image retention and burn in and it gradually got more noticeable as the weeks went on. At very low brightness there is a black bar/line that runs across from home punch camera but I don't really mind that because it's only visible from 0- like 30% ish brightness. It's the image retention that worries me for long term use. I personally have tried two units one from Amazon and OnePlus directly and both had the same issues. I didn't want to take the risk so I returned. I wouldn't recommend this phone with that display issue but if your unit is good then that's awesome.",8 people found this helpful,Yes
