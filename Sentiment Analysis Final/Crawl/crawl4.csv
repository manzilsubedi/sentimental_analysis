Nice feel to the hand. The back cover is plastic but solid. It has a gorgeous indigo blue finish but smears or prints easily. Who cares when everyone puts a cover on a phone anyway, right? Big screen size but narrow enough to hold with one hand. No worries about LCD screen. Very bright and easy to see. I was just out today in the sun and my screen very easy to see and read. Fingerprint reader is lightning fast. Fastest I've ever had. The cool thing is you can scan or use multiple finger prints so I use both my index finger prints a lot on it depending what hand I am using at the time. No face recognition but who cares! No idea why people have to have this. You're opening your phone up people, that's it. Takes a second. Geesh. Speakers are on both ends (dual speakers) so very nice and clear. Loud, too. I was out landscaping in my yard today, laid my phone down on a chair, and I easily heard my 80's music crisp and clear; did not need a Bluetooth speaker (even though that would make it much louder as we know). Headphone jack is an added feature. Camera is very nice! High quality pictures! Quality zoom focus and clear and colorful pictures (I have a few examples). A little cool feature is you can place 3 fingers on the face of your phone and screen shot. This is great since I screen shot a lot. When navigating through the phone, the processor is very fast and smooth experience. With all of these positives, then an extra bonus is the unique stylus tucked away perfectly. Writes very smooth and easily and is just plain fun! I'm a teacher, so very nice to have a note taking device when I quickly need it without frantically looking for a pen or pencil and paper. Just convenient to have in grocery store or when a quick idea comes to mind. Using screen protectors does NOT effect the stylus at all either. The battery life is Great out of my own Rating: Exceptional/Great/Good/Poor. Even though it's not exceptional, the phone charges fast, so no big deal in my opinion. I will never understand why people waste their money on a phone with a battery ""on steroids"" that lasts 2 or 3 days and pay an arm and a leg for it especially when you charge it up every night anyway. Also, amazing storage!Note: At first, I thought this phone didn't have the capability to change the volume on notifications or texts. Well, it does. The side buttons are of course for sound, vibration, or silent like most phones and are used for Media Sound for FB, YouTube videos, calls, etc. You have to go to SOUND in Settings and use the Ring Volume to control the notifications or texts sounds. There's also a Call Volume and an Alarm Volume in this same SOUND Setting. I hope this helps.For $299, I'm shocked this stylus and phone is so solid. Highly recommend this phone!The only negatives or cons is that it doesn't have wireless charging but not a deal breaker for me. Also, I wish it had a notification blinking light to notify me when I have a message but not a deal breaker once again.",331 people found this helpful,Yes

Opening websites, Google images is actually faster than some of more expensive phones I've tried before! Action camera takes rather decent videos. In right lighting, photos come out crisp. Stylus is useful in taking quick notes. Dual speakers and headphone jack are great fratures to have and keep.Cons: battery life for a 4000 mah phone is rather disappointing even for first day use. Roughly 5 hours of screen on time. Moto display, where you wave your hand to turn on screen is absent. This was one useful feature from Moto. Instead you get one tap checking. Last but not least is pure Android issue. Many Android phones allow you to control notification volume separately. Unfortunately, Moto follows Google Pixel's pure form and removes this feature. You'll have to silence ringer or media volume to silence your texts which seems like a huge step backwards.Conclusion: overall, this is a solid device for its price. With only a battery letdown being a clear issue, the G Stylus can be a great daily device for anyone who doesn't wanna spend $500-$1000+ on a phone.",170 people found this helpful,Yes

I use a galaxy s10 for work but needed to replace my old s8 that I had been using for personal use. I didn't want to shell out over $1000 for a flagship and picked this up when I saw it for $299. Overall the phone is snappy and I don't have any complaints comparing it to my other phone. The screen is noticibly worse especially around the camera cutout where you can see some hazyness but that's to be expected for $700 cheaper. It performs fairly nice in casual games and you won't have any issues scrolling through your news feed.The reason I give it 3 stars has to do with the service. I'm on the same network as before calling the same people so I am sure it's the phone. I can not have a call go longer than 20/30 minutes without the call just randomly dropping. My husband is in the military and gone for the moment so I end up making a ton more phone calls than the average person. We are usually on the phone 3+ hours every single day. To make matters worse there is no audible noise when a call is ended making it even more frustrating. You could be explaining something and you look up and they've missed everything you said.If you only text or use groupme and social media this phone does the job great. But phones are calling devices for me and I honestly can't recommend one that has this many service issues.,155 people found this helpful,Yes

I changed the storage location of my photos (in the camera app) to the SD card and took a photo.  I was able to edit & save the photo, but not delete it.  It also saves the edited photo to the phone's internal storage.  No problem.  I can go to ""files"", find it in the images and then delete it in either location.All in all, this is a great phone for the money!Updated 07/24/20.  I originally gave this phone 3 stars because it is the only phone that I know of that does not have a ""gallery"" and Google Photos cannot access photos on an SD card without the gallery. (More info below)  I have read reviews where people complained about there being no navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen, but there is an option in settings to use normal navigation buttons (search for system navigation).  Someone complained about battery life, since this phone has a larger battery than most, but the more you use it, the better it gets.  It stops apps from running in the background when you don't use them very often.  I am very pleased with the battery life and I have tons of apps on the phone.  All in all, this is a great budget phone.  It takes better pictures than any other budget phones I've had and has more internal storage, plus even more with the slot for a micro SD card.  Even Motorola says that you can put another launcher on the phone to do emore with it.  I install Nova Launcher Premium on every phone I buy; it is well worth it!  I also install the Microsoft SwiftKey Keyboard to create the kind of keyboard I have on my PC with a number row on top and to ""swipe"" type.  I'm not good with my thumbs.Now for my 1st review:  I like the phone, but if you want to save/edit pictures saved to the micro SD card using Google Photos, forget it.  Motorola did away with the photo gallery and Google Photos cannot access the SD card without the gallery.  Eventually your photos & videos will take more & more of the internal storage, unless you use the Google Cloud only & delete the photos from the internal storage.  Why have the SD card if you can't put your pictures & videos on it, Motorola?!",109 people found this helpful,Yes

This and other Moto phones were looking like the best choice for mid-range phones in USA. I was excited to get this phone (Moto G Stylus, the most expensive and best specs of the 3)Sadly, my first week of owning this phone has consisted of being on hold with Verizon for 40 minutes, and spending hours googling solutions to a very odd problem that arose. ***This phone's call quality is garbage if VoLTE (Voice Over LTE) is not turned on in the settings.***Also, VoLTE is not necessarily a setting that is available by default. In my case, it was completely absent from my phone, until I logged into the Verizon Wireless website and added ""HD Voice"" to my plan. Then this setting finally showed up, I was able to toggle it on, and my call quality went back to normal.I hope this post helps somebody.",60 people found this helpful,Yes

Your data cut you off on the call mode. I spend 4 hrs with Verzion stores and getting help with this phone. Verzion technical support been helping with the too. Also verzion try contacting Moto technical support and they wasn't being helpful at all. So I contacted Amazon support and try tell them this phone don't have all options for the carriers. I'm not getting helpful. So if you have Verzion carrier or prepaid. Don't bother get the phone. Otherwise you will lose your $300 for it.

This has resulted in my old phone not being able to function on the network starting early next year.It took me a lot of research to identify a suitable replacement.  In the past I have never paid attention to technical details of a phone such as the frequency bands it supports, etc.  But you have to if you plan to use this device on T-Mobile.  This device supports the important 4G bands that T-Mobile uses, 2, 4, 5, 12, 66 and 71.  The last one, 71, is particularly hard to find on many cheap unlocked handsets, especially from chinese brands like Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo, etc.  Major brands like Samsung support it, but sometimes only on handsets made for the US market, not the international versions (which are often cheaper and have additional features like dual-sim).I had to settle for this model even though it did not have some of the features I like in a phone at this price-point, such as dual-sim and NFC.  It is a shame how much manufacturers cripple a device just because they support one important feature that their competitors in the price range do not.  Because they can get away with it.So, here are the pros and cons of this device in simple terms:Pros:  Android 10, with very minimal bloatware, etc.  Mostly stock android with only a few moto-specific apps and featuresThe device feels solid and has an aluminum frameThe screen is very good, good size, good brightness, good pixel density.  High screen to body ratio, decent colorsThe touch screen is very responsiveVery good amount of system memory and RAM.  You will not run out of space for your apps, photos, music, etc. that easily and the 4GB of RAM means it is easier to multi-task without the device lagging or stutteringExpandable memory with a microSD cardThe fingerprint reader is quite accurate and responsiveCall quality is great, and the speakerphone is loud and clearThe camera takes great pictures, especially in good lighting conditionsThere are some neat features that require some experimenting with to take full advantage of such as your choice of Android 10 navigation or 3-button navigation, attentive display (to keep the screen on when you are looking at it), etc.GPS has alternatives like GLONASS and Galileo, so you are not restricted to the use of US GPS satellitesIf you prefer using a stylus on a regular basis or for fine work, this is one of the few devices with a stylus built-inMost importantly, I used the IMEI check on TMobile's website, and this phone is fully supported with all the latest features and capabilities such as VoLTE, etc.Cons:  It is not Android One, the pure stock version of AndroidThe device is a little chunky, with my old phone from 3 years back being significantly thinner and lighter (this phone is more than a third of an inch thick while many other phones are less than a quarter of an inch thick)The phone does not have gorilla glass in the front, and has only a plastic back - though it is shiny and attractive, if you are looking for more high-end construction, this is not the phone for youThe phone is not water or dust-proof.  It is splash-resistant, so you should be ok if the phone gets a few drops of water on it due to rain, etc., but don't immerse it in waterThe brains of the device is an older processor, and it is not as powerful or zippy as higher-end devices with newer, faster processors.  If you are an avid gamer with a penchant for high frame-rate games, this is probably not the ideal device for youThe screen is IPS LCD, not AMOLED.  So, don't expect black blacks and perfect color reproduction or extreme contrast.  And the refresh rate is only 60 Hz.  Many newer devices have moved on to 90 Hz and some high-end devices are setting the standard with 120 Hz and 144 Hz displaysThere is face unlock, but it is not offered as the default - mainly because it is 2D face recognition, so it is less secure and can be fooled by using an actual-size photo of you, for exampleThe hole-punch selfie camera can be a bit of a distraction since it draws your eyes towards itself when you are looking at something like a youtube video in full-screen mode.  I would have preferred a thin top bezel for the selfie camera, notification LED, etc.And speaking of notification LED, there is noneSame goes for NFC and dual-simThe camera is not great in low-light conditions - it is not bad, but depending on the conditions, it can over-expose bright areas and make the dark areas completely black, or it can make the picture grainy.  HDR photos can take a few seconds to process and you have to hold still while doing it, so pictures may become blurry because of shake if you use that featureAlso, the action camera, which is a wide-angle camera that enables you to take horizontal videos while holding the phone vertically, is a gimmick - it can only be used for video, not for wide-angle still shotsThe stylus is mostly also a gimmick - there are no special features specific to the stylus.  And the stylus itself is not an electronic device with its own smarts - you can use any stylus with the phone.  The only advantage of this stylus is that it fits in the phone's stylus slot so that you don't have to carry it around separatelyMotorola has a habit of not updating android versions on their devices frequently or on a timely fashion, so I don't expect this device to get past Android 11 - this is a future criticism and I would be happy to be proved wrong!Overall, I like the device so far.  It is in the correct price range (I don't want to spend more than $100/year on a cellphone, and I have never managed to hold onto a device for more than 3 years, so $300 is my upper limit for price).  It has full support for my carrier, which is a very important consideration.  The features on this phone are par for the course when it comes to devices in its price range, so even though I have listed many cons, it is mostly a wishlist that I wish can be accommodated on a sub-$300 phone rather than just the high-end devices.If you have specific questions about the device, please post as a comment and I will try to answer them.",28 people found this helpful,Yes

I must see ads to look at my photos.I was forced to agree to use Google cloud or not see my videos.Photo storage is very random.

However I do have some things I'm not feeling... 1. There is no way to replace your stylus. I even went to Motorola support to purchase one, they are only able to warranty it. I don't really understand how you can come out with a stylus phone with a stylus that is unreplaceable… 2. This is more of the android issue... This android 10 uses gesture to navigate. So no back button, home button  or recent apps button. Its all swipes. This can get frustrating. For example swiping through pictures you can accidently go back or vice versa.  Or if you swype, trying to go back starts swiping for words instead of actually putting away the keyboard. Things like that. I mean you can live with it, but these types of things wouldn't exist if there were the dedicated buttons. Other than that the phone is Great.I always do a full investigation before buying a phone. Most reviews on the internet give budget phones an ok review just because it cost less. But $300 upfront is not a budget phone in my opinion. Anything under two is to me. Anyways, I'm an artist and having a stylus phone is an extra plus. Phone has been smooth and looks cool. Stylus is great for an artist. The phone is Fast and has the most recent Android which is a breath of fresh air. It's a bit thicker than what I am used too. Reviews bash the camera, this camera is great, seriously. It worked well in light and dark. This is exactly what your getting. It's a great phone.",20 people found this helpful,Yes

Despite what the mfr. tells you, I can take it off the charge on a Friday morning, use it continuously for the weekend and still have 29 percent remaining come Sunday night! The battery is lasting me about three days with heavy usage and about four, maybe five with light usage.I'm not used to that after having only 3000 mAh batteries!I also like that the 4000 mAh is lighter and smaller than a 5000 mAh battery. So I think its a huge plus all around.The stylus works perfectly and notes are no problem at all. Not sure why most reviews say they aren't.The display is phenomenal!!! Audio is exceptional. The antennas are far better than anything else Motorola has ever sold!!! They will pick up network and wifi signals 10 to 30 times greater than previous versions of Moto phones!  Thus increasing the ability of usage.I like it! I like it a lot!!!",19 people found this helpful,Yes

Mostly I don't care, I just make myself get used to it no matter what. This phone has a feature that is impossible to get used to, and is insane. I cannot believe it would make it into the finished product.Motorola changes the home, back, and open apps buttons with every new generation of phone. Once they find something that works, they change it anyway. I'm not sure why. They always change it. 100% of the time. With the Stylus you swipe the bottom bar for Home, or the open apps menu. No big deal. If you haven't had a phone like that, you get used to it. However, the back button... It is not really on the bottom bar anymore. You actually swipe the whole screen. So if you're on amazon, changing sizes on a pair of shoes... It goes back to the previous page instead of scrolling sizes. Any app that lets you swipe over to the next screen, such as Snapchat, Facebook, and almost all social media app... It goes back instead. It's not a finesse thing. It's not something you'll learn to get better at. It will do it at will, and at random. You'll swipe shorter, hoping it will help, and it won't. You'll swipe quicker, longer, slower... Nothing will help. It will just occasionally swipe you back and you will lose your spot. On occasion, this could be catastrophic and make you start over at something. This phone would be devastating to use for work. Hopefully they can update this absurd feature away.I also notice on this phone, it isn't precise with swiping. It's the first phone I've had in many generations that swipes poorly. You swipe up, and once in a while it scrolls down instead. Once in a while you swipe down, and it scrolls up instead. This will become very apparent with certain apps more than others. I am guessing it has to do with the added stylus. The screen has to be made to work with the included stylus. Either way, it gave up quality of use for some reason.The stylus will not work with other devices and other devices stylus' won't work with this. That isn't a big deal, but something you should know if you have large hands and cannot handle the skinny stylus included. The one you have with your other device almost certainly won't work. Keep that in mind.The phone is not actually bigger than the previous generation, it just has a larger screen. That is good if you upgraded but didn't want an oversized phone. It is heavier however. The screen size increase, does not increase the keyboard size at all. This was terrible for me, as I'm always looking for a slightly bigger phone. I have large hands and will have to end up one day buying a overpriced, bloatware filled Samsung to get my hands to fit the keyboard.I want to like the phone, and hopefully I'll learn to love it. At the time, it feels like a downgrade. Or at the very least, no improvement at all.",17 people found this helpful,Yes

I would have chosen a different phone if I had known that it would be this difficult.  I've had to resort to eBay to get the SIM card I need and I'm hoping I don't get ripped off.  If it works, I'll update this.Update: As of June 2020 the SIM required for Sprint/Boost/Virgin activation is SIMOLW416TQ. This is very hard to find.

The touch screen lags, even doing something as simple as dialing or punching in numbers on keypad, The screen always has a backlight which keeps me up at night when using my white noise/clock  app. The stylus might as well have been left out. It's nothing like a Samsung. No led notification that I have received a call or message. I hate that! I'm always missing things. when I tap on a notification on lock screen and open it it doesn't go to that place like Sam, it just gets rid of the notification and I have to look for it..
