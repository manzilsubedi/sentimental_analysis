Before I bought these, I was suffering from Builtinspeakeritis. I couldn't tell left from right, high from low. It affected every aspect of my life. Music seemed dull and lifeless. I watched an episode of Tiger King and found it pedestrian. My life was so incomplete that, when I went out, people looked at me like I was a nobody... if they looked at me at all.This set of speakers changed everything. Sure, the sound is tinny, and they don't get much louder than a mouse fart. But now when I'm watching COPS, I can tell whether the perp is being chased from off-screen left or off-screen right. I find myself thumping along in the tub to Chumbawamba. And Zoom meetings for work? Well, let's just say that these days I hear the voice of Renee from Accounting in my dreams.Owning these speakers has totally changed how people respond to me, too. Ladies smile at me at the grocery store now. I mean, I can't actually see them smiling, since they're wearing masks to avoid COVID-19, but I can just tell that this time the checkout girl isn't going to report me to the manager.Before buying these, I had tried everything: $100/hour online counseling with a surprisingly attractive Eastern European therapist; blue pills from a registered pharmacy in Uruguay; even subzero naked yoga (don't ask). It turns out, I could have spared my wallet (and my genitals) the pain. All I needed was this inexpensive pair of speakers—with its blindingly bright blue LED and its complete absence of bass—to get me back in the game. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to find out more about that hottie Carole Baskin on Tiger King.",88 people found this helpful,Yes

Occasionally, but not often, the speakers will distort audio beyond recognition. Unplugging and replugging them in a few times normally solves the problem, but it's a big annoyance.  From glancing at other reviews, I've gleaned not I'm not the only one with these problems, even if they aren't very common.

I got them to use for my work computer. They've served the sound purpose just fine so far though I've only had them a few months. However, 1 thing I would like to see changed on these speakers is the ""On"" light.  It is a VERY intense, bright blue light.  I love having a light on the speakers to signify that they are on, but the high intensity blue light is hard on the eyes if you don't position the speakers away from you.The second thing is something very odd I've never had with speakers before. I switch back and forth between using a microphone headset for zoom meetings and when not zooming, have the speakers on so I can hear work IM's coming in if I'm working in another program.Sometimes, if you turn the knob to ""off"" the speakers turn themselves on again.  The first time this happened, I thought it was just me that had forgotten. But nope, this has happened multiple times, even if I turn the knob left until it CLICKS into the office position, it is not uncommon to come back later and find it not clicked off.  I know. It sounds crazy. Yet when they do that, you still have to click them off then on again to get them truly working.So while the sound has been fine for my needs, I'm not sure I would buy these same speakers again.",N/A,Yes
