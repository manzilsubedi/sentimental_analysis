Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.*Update, I'm really satisfied with the performance of the phone. Battery life with the 120hz screen is acceptable and can still last the whole day with moderate use. The rear camera is nice but the front facing camera leaves more to be desired. The performance is definitely there with the Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram. I used to use a phone with 8gb of ram and I don't notice a difference (I always have multiple apps open). My original opinion still stands. There have also been reports of touchscreen issues. This has not affected me. Samsung sent out an update to correct this issue for those who had it.",231 people found this helpful,Yes

Plus on Amazon it saved me an extra 100. I have tmobile. And I switched my sim out from my S9. Phone calls and texting worked immediately but it took me a couple hours to get the mobile data running. But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.I did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed.

I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.",114 people found this helpful,No

One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.",41 people found this helpful,Yes

   This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem.

The 5 was $100 more ($699) than Amazon's price of S20 FE of $599 at release (*S20 FE now $699) with the 5 using processing power of a few generations back with smaller battery capacity - this was a no brainer choice and Google over priced their flagship (I understand their camera is generally good and updates faster/ui cleaner - but that's not making up for everything else especially considering competition from this phone and OnePlus among others).It's still brand new so time will tell a lot more but the phone is snappy and my wifi & cell signal are faster than my Honor View 10 that's being replaced. I use T-mobile and not in a 5G area yet (but one is close by I'll be able to test). I attached a pic of my speed test info on cell network. The bottom 2 similar results are default with 5G enabled in the cellular settings and the top (fastest) results is with the second option of 4G LTE/3/2 enabled. I thankfully read a post to disable 5G if not in network for one. My old phone would only get 25 download on average so the S20 FE has blown that away even at its worst.I took a photo in an average edge lit room of some colored items and a pic in a very low light room (any light coming in is from a room at least 10ft away). I'm blown away by the low light pic - I can't explain how well lit the pic is compared to what my eyes perceive.The first day I spent my time uninstalling and disabling whatever I could that was pre-installed by Samsung and tweaked shortcuts & and new to me (Samsung specific) features I wanted. I used the recommended Smart Switch to transfer files from my old phone (namely apps, selected pics, and texts & call records) and I used my saved backup from my launcher (Nova) to bring back the app/screen organization I had customized on my old phone. Now I get to enjoy.It does charge fast and no problems connecting to 2 different Bluetooth headsets.*Update* I realized my original download speed pic was clipped wrong (showed a 2G wifi download speed instead of LTE) so I removed the old and uploaded correct pic (speed increase still stands).I placed prices in as they've changed since I purchased.You can choose to bring your screen refresh to 60 to help extend battery (defaults at 120 - I recommend scrolling feeds and testing both out in other scenarios to see if it's worth it for you). As always, to extend battery on any phone, control background apps and their access, lower your screen brightness when able and keep GPS, wifi, Bluetooth off when not needed. If your phone has bad reception in an area you spend a prolonged period of time in and you don't need to call/text, put your phone in airplane mode and turn wifi on after (if wifi available/needed).",29 people found this helpful,Yes

Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don't mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I'm still looking myself. Good luck!",21 people found this helpful,Yes

If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.",17 people found this helpful,Yes

For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.",14 people found this helpful,Yes
