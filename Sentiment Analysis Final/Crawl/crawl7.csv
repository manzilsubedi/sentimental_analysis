If you don’t care about dropped calls go for it!,Shame on Apple for releasing before they worked out the bugs. Disgusting.  And Tana? Chip? No one seems to bother to even acknowledge a massive returns and compliance worldwide that it drops calls within 30 seconds to 2 minutes and sometimes the speaker works and sometimes it doesn’t. I spent every day for three weeks troubleshooting every possible way and nothing fixed it. Look at the forum read the other reviews again this is everyone all models and worldwide. And now you can’t buy the 11s anymore from Apple because it was the last model?!! Well I found it at Best Buy and you can get AppleCare and the phone is perfect. Apple put me in a really bad situation where I was switching over numbers and had to go back to my back up phone and had no time to even transition the number that I was going to switch from. The whole thing has just been a disaster thank God I returned both of them within the two week period. They finally told me I’m better off returning and not trying to set up a third phone. I think I would’ve lost my mind doing it three times & returning three times! People in line with me we’re taking theirs back but everyone acts like they are surprised when you mention issues. Apple Support will tell you they have no idea what you’re talking about it’s unbelievable!  Check Google! Check the Apple forum! Very sorry for those of you who did not! One tec said when the S versions come out about a year later they usually work out the bugs. I am more than annoyed at the time and money I’ve put into this phone. Don’t buy it yet!!!!!!,6 people found this helpful,No
