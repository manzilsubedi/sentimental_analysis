I thought you were high tech...,"They give you the driver on an optical disc. For those of you who don't know, a driver is a piece of software the operating system needs to identify and run new hardware components. Without a functioning driver, the device is useless. If amazon was serious about providing a good product they would put the driver on a flash drive or link to a download on the product page.  Some people are posting third party websites to download a driver, but I'd prefer to have a driver from a trusted source. People could pack a lot of malicious code in a driver so you really have to be careful where you install it from. I guess amazon has yet to figured out that optical drives are on their way out and most laptops don't have them anymore. Maybe amazon will be nice enough to send my beeper a page when this driver is available on a more up to date medium. Until then, I guess I will spend my time organizing my film negatives and cassette tapes. I wouldn't even be that upset if I had to catch the steam engine into town to pick up the new driver medium.

Essentially, plug in the ethernet adapter and bend it up to the open part along the top of the dock. Then, 'S' route the ethernet cable along the top, down the left side, and out of the cable management hole. This will allow the back cover to close and maintain a clean look (I've attached photos below). Using a flat ethernet cable helps a lot as well; mine came with an Asus router that I use at home.Download/Upload speeds have improved compared to 5GHz Wi-Fi. Even though the Switch's USB-C is locked at USB 2.0 speeds at the moment, using the built-in speed test determined that download speeds almost doubled and upload speeds increased by about 25%. I've attached screenshots of those results below.Until Nintendo releases firmware that unlocks use of the USB 3.0 standard on the Switch, we'll be stuck with around 100Mbps download speeds. However, using this ethernet adapter will result in a faster and more stable connection compared to Wi-Fi for most people.Again, well done AmazonBasics.Original Review [09-08-2016]Got this to use with my Razer Blade Stealth which doesn't come with a LAN port.I got full gigabit transfer speeds when moving large files across my local network.NAS (FreeNAS) to Blade Stealth = 113 MB/sDesktop (Win10) to Blade Stealth = 110 MB/sBlade Stealth to Desktop = 107 MB/sEven when plugged into

MacBooks no longer come with Ethernet ports, but this thing works pretty much as well as a laptop with a built-in Ethernet port.  It's not quite plug-and-play on macOS. You'll need to install drivers from the Asix website (the chip manufacturer for the adapter); I found it by searching ""asix AX88179"", navigating to their website, and scrolling down to their drivers section. It'll run you through the installer, and you will need to reboot at the end. Once it's done, it'll pretty much auto-detect and connect you to the network. If not, you can just go into the Network Preferences pane and check to see if ""AX88179 USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet"" is connected.  It is indeed plug-and-play with Ubuntu, and probably will be for other Debian-based distros. I haven't had the chance to test on Windows, but network speeds on Ubuntu and macOS are pretty much the same as on my desktop with a built-in network card.  The Ethernet plug has the typical built-in LEDs to show activity and connection speed, and cables click in pretty solidly. I haven't moved it around much so I can't say much about cycle life. The USB cable feels a bit rigid, but I guess that's typical of USB 3.0 cables due to the increased number of conductors.

To some extent I do feel their pain - Apple has a bad track record of moving the API cheese a lot.

They were 11 bucks at the time and, now, I wish I had bought more because they are no longer available and the current crop of AX88179 adapters are all more expensive.

I would guess their compatibility with the Nintendo Switch has created higher demand which then inflated the prices i.e. Economics 101.-My older Accell adapters mentioned above have a smaller-gauge 4"" cable that is very flexible and allow the door on the back of the Nintendo Switch dock to close when plugged in, so I installed them on the Switch docks at both of our TVs.  When I came here looking for replacements, I chose this adapter because the open-box option is plentiful and puts it closer to what I paid in 2013.  To be clear, I can confirm that this AmazonBasics USB to Gigabit adapter is compatible with the Switch dock, but the short cable/fat body would definitely NOT allow the door to close unless you use some sort of USB extension cable.

For those quick to say that Air is too thin for an RJ45 - no, it's not (it only looks that way). Especially considering Apple's trademark precision in manufacturing. Anyway, I digress...Just get the latest driver from asix.com.tw, follow the included PDF to install, and you are good to go. Watch out for the pop-up after the reboot, asking to load a system extension. You must allow it. If you don't, or just close the pop-up, it gets disabled (happened to me).

I am a bit concerned about the USB cable, as the only strain relief for it is a little countersink in the hole where the cable goes into the box. But the cable feels very solid, and it may be enough.

I never realized my XPS did not come with an ethernet port until at that moment when I went to go plug the cable in, I couldn't find a spot. With this it is super easy to use, plug it into your USB slot, plug the ethernet cord into the slot and you're online!

From 72.0 Mbps (wi-fi) to 100.0 Mbps (ethernet connection) to 1.0 Gbps on my new laptop using this adapter!!!!!,"Wow!!!!!  From 72.0 Mbps (wi-fi) to 100.0 Mbps (ethernet connection) on my old previous laptop to 1.0 Gbps on my new laptop using this adapter!!!!!  Since my new laptop came without an ethernet port – and because I really wanted this specific new laptop -- I resigned myself to using my wi-fi connection instead.  My current internet provider seems notorious for slow internet speeds.  Watching streaming video and even accessing the internet was trying my patience constantly but -- even if a higher speed was available in my area the cost would be more than I was willing and able to pay.  I googled this problem to see if others experienced same problem.  Googling and speaking with a customer service representative at my internet providers suggested that – as an alternative -- I use an ethernet connection which would make a very noticeable difference in connection speeds.  Using my ethernet connection my speed jumped from 72.0 Mbps to 100.0 Mbps; however, the speed was still lagging.  I was ""shopping"" here on Amazon (BTW, Amazon is my one-stop shopping with exception to my groceries.  Amazon is amazing, and they are credible and reputable and stand behind their satisfaction guarantee as well as stepping in when a third-party seller did not measure up to their guarantee and return policies.  Mind you, that only happened one time where Amazon had to step in to resolve the issue.  Anyway, I digress.  Nothing usual!  LOL.  I was searching out of curiosity to find out if there was some way to connect to ethernet without an ethernet port available.  I discovered this alternate solution.  I was pleasingly surprised when I switched to just wi-fi connection on my new laptop just to see what the difference was between the Mbps and using this adapter.  I was used to the wi-fi connection speed being 72.0 Mbps and never even thought of checking to see what it would be on my new laptop.  I do not know why but my new laptop using wi-fi was a whopping 144.0 Mbps versus my old laptop internet connection speed.  I do not know why this is, but I will take the “WIN”.",4 people found this helpful,Yes

The Nintendo switch had awful WiFi signal, even if standing directly next to the router. I was getting roughly 16 megabits per second while my connection is over 400 megabits per second. Once wired, I was getting up to 88 megabits per second which is still Far Below what I am able to get. All my other devices are able to get the full amount, so it seems the switch has a limitation of around 100 megabits per second anyway. The only flaw with this device is that the wire between the USB and the ethernet hub is too short for the switch, therefore you have to leave the back of the switch dock open while using this device. That is a small price to pay for a much better connection, as the download and upload don't really matter but the decrease in ping time is necessary for online games, such as Mario Kart.",6 people found this helpful,Yes

Have it going through a non-external powered USB 3.0 hub too.Cheaper than alternatives, especially by Apple, and honestly wanted something USB so I don't have to keep plugging a bunch of cables into my MBP every time I'm at the desk, just my USB hub with everything else plugged into that already.Things worth noting though and why I took a star off:1. Installation was weird, used the download link on the product page (few paragraphs below the price), everything installed fine. But it didn't work. It would detect the device in System Report, but it wouldn't recognize I had a cable plugged in. I reinstalled the drivers again, and it worked.2. The drivers aren't signed and recognized by Apple. It's not even by Amazon, it's using a Taiwan / Chinese manufacturer that I've never heard of. When allowing the drivers to install in Security settings, you just see a random name ""Hua La Le"" or something. Fine, go for it. But it kind of sucks since I'm installing a driver without knowing what's in it, and some loose connection with Amazon.",5 people found this helpful,Yes
