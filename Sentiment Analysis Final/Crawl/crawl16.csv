We have individual bedrooms where we are allowed to mount a television. This unit fit perfectly and, from where I lay on my bed, it is about 10' to the screen. I almost bought a sound bar to accompany it, but I read the reviews and everyone commented on how well the sound worked on the unit. In my small area, it will blast you out. The sound quality is fine for what I need, especially since out of volume levels from 1-100 I usually have it at about 10-15 depending on the source of programming. It was really easy to set up with onscreen prompts. I subscribe to Fubo and it wasn't pre-loaded, so I just logged into Fubo on the television internet and downloaded it, put my password in and I was off to the races.  I've only had it less than a week, so I have no idea how durable it will be, but, it seems to be fine.",58 people found this helpful,Yes

All parts (remote, feet, cord, instructions) were easy to find in the box. Set up was easy! Sound quality is great, switch to “music” setting in sound settings for improved sound. The remote makes things easier to navigate the tv and Fire app. Voice remote is a bonus! Can’t go wrong for the price - a 50” tv with all the integrated goodies. I got the 4 yr warrant for $30 just in case. I’m super happy with this purchase. Frankly, I don’t understand when people give negative reviews for things like being hard of hearing and blame the tv?

The picture and sound quality are really good. It functions like a 4k fire tv stick but you can connect it with an ethernet cable. The only things I don't like about it so far is that you can't set up a speaker pair with your echo speakers like you can with the 4k fire tv stick. The remote is also very limited. Although the quick app launch buttons (Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and HBO) can put you straight into those apps even when the TV is off, just by using those buttons instead of the power button. Adjusting the picture required me to go back to the home screen then use the settings button on the remote, which was a little annoying, but after I was done settings everything up wasn't a big deal. I picked up this 50 inch 4k TV for $300 so I still feel the overall value for the money was well worth it. -UPDATE- (8-20-20) I realized my issue with the picture settings was that I just wasn't pressing the settings button long enough. A quick tap will not bring up the settings, but if you hold the button down for a second it comes right up as it should. Another feature that I like is when you are on the home screen and you highlight an input (which you can name) it will show you a real-time picture/ video of what that input is currently displaying in the top right corner of the screen. 5 Stars all day!!!

The TV met my expectations. Make sure you set your expectations right before buying this product or you'll end up here writing negative reviews.I want now to address some complaints that I read from other buyers.1. The TV is very light. I can easily carry it with one arm. The stand legs are fine too. Some people complain that the stand legs are thin and not sturdy. They are thin, but they are metallic and very sturdy.2. The picture is good enough. The blacks are not very deep, but I didn't get a TV to see black screens. People complain about not seeing 4K. I do get 4K and it looks fine. The source must be in 4K and your internet must be at least 15Mbs otherwise it switches to 1080p.3. The sound is fine too. To be honest I always have the TV on low volume. After all I didn't buy it as a stereo.4. The Fire TV software needs a little getting used to but that's true for everything.5. People complain about little space to store apps. That's true. Personally, I only use antenna and a few streaming apps (YouTube, Twitch, Prime Video). Plenty of space for that. If you want more apps at the same time then you need to use a USB stick.The only real problem I encountered was that the TV lost picture 2 times while watching antenna channels. Other people had this problem as well. Interestingly enough, I maintained picture on the streaming apps. The problem went away once I unplugged the TV. That makes me think that it's a software issue rather than a physical problem. I also reduced the back light density to 60% and since then I haven't had the problem again.That's my review.
