I originally was considering more expensive options, but I had tried his Chromebook for a couple hours (writing a paper using it) and I liked it too. I ordered a new one, and upon receiving it I plugged it into the charger for its first charge. The laptop seemed to work great in general when I started changing my settings and searching for websites.  However, the charger fit into the charging port very loosely, and when I moved the laptop on my lap it fell out easily. I figured I might have gotten a laptop with a faulty charging port and I returned it for a replacement.The second new Acer Chromebook R11 that Amazon sent me had a normal charging port. The charger fit well and did not fall out. But, the touchpad did not work. I tried to troubleshoot it and change touchpad settings, however every time I moved my fingers on the touch pad the cursor jumped around the screen. I ended up returning this one as well and choosing a more expensive laptop from a different company as I planned originally. My friend's Acer Chromebook R11 works fine and he has had it about 6 months. He was surprised that I had these troubles.I'm not sure what the quality control process is. It seems the experience with this laptop depends on whether one receives a fully functional one.",210 people found this helpful,Yes

I needed something that would last all day, be lightweight, and still be used like a PC when I'm not at home.This is exactly what I was wanting! Even though it's a Chrome OS, all of the apps you get makes it feel like a PC. Use this as a laptop, then fold the keyboard backwards and use it as a tablet. The touch screen can also be used in laptop mode. It's all very responsive. The battery lasts ALL day! Depending on what you're doing with it and how you use it and for how long, you can make it last a few days before you have to recharge it. I usually am able to use it and charge it every third day or so.This is also able to load most all Google Play apps, just like your Android phone!

I'm an attorney and I actually bought it for a specific trial that required a lot of really long distance travel. It is MUCH more convenient than my heavy laptop and I don't feel any meaningful difference. Lighter, more shockproof, no fan or spinning hard drive to bang up, and no heat dissipation issues.This only has 20GB memory. Not a problem for most, since they're meant to work from Google Drive or other cloud storage. But sensitive case files can't go on those, so I stuck a 512GB sd card in there. As I wrote in an answer, this was ""hilarious overkill,"" but it did the job and eliminated all fear of filling it up before trial.My productivity has massively increased since getting this, simply because I have something handy to work from at all times. No more wishing I could tinker with a motion when my laptop is too inconvenient to set up (or not with me). This thing boots in under 2 seconds and I'm plugging away. 10 hour battery life means I charge it at night and that's it, unless I'm actually traveling and therefore using it all day (rather than my desktop or laptop).The only limitations are inherent to the android apps. Adobe doesn't support rendering documents text readable, and MS Word has fewer features as well. That's ok, those are mostly things I can do in the ""polishing"" phase from my office computer. This gets me to the 99% mark when I would otherwise be stuck.My wife has seen me using this for about a week now and is already asking me if I plan to keep it after this trial. She either wants this one, or one just like it. I predict I will keep this one if it holds up. Admittedly, I'm still a bit suspicious of a device like this that costs 1/5 what my phone costs, and half of my tablet's price. But so far, so good!",12 people found this helpful,Yes

The cons a very simple the list. First of all it's slow, but given the processor and the 4 gigabytes of RAM that's no surprise.

Set up was a breeze, got all links and apps installed with no issues. We quickly realized that we needed another Chromebook due to class schedules and workload. We bought this one as it was comparable in price and supposed hardware.First off it was half of the speed of the Lenovo C330 (MediaTek MT8173C), and it is not seen as an Android device which prevents child's accounts from logging in! The accounts are set up properly as each tablet, phone, and (the other) Chromebook loads just fine. Acer's modified OS makes this a useless addition to any family.Other changes compared to typical Laptop/Chromebooks:-Proprietary Charger: Doesn't use USB-C or any other general charger type. Meaning you are forced to carry this charger around with you.-Heavy: Try asking your 5-8 year old carry this around with them.-Flimsy Plastic: Lifting the corner of the screen to show the display, the entire corner bends. I'm very surprised I didn't shatter the screen.Return Please.",3 people found this helpful,Yes

I was asked to send it in for repair, which I did. When I got it back I again didn't get around to using it until a month or so (after return window) and right away after about 5 minutes of using it the touch pad again was unresponsive on and off. I tried to fill out another repair request (really just want to return it at this point) & received an email back stating they couldn't fulfill that request & I needed to call them. After calling them they said I have to send it in again so that is what I will have to do which is very inconvenient. I would caution about buying such an inexpensive computer. It seemed like a good deal at the time but it's very inconvenient having a touch pad that doesn't always work.",5 people found this helpful,Yes

Just what I wanted.,"This is my first Chromebook and I was hesitant to switch from Wind*** OS because that is all I have known. I was wanting to replace my tablet. This was the perfect solution because now I have that and more.  The play store did not work right away. It needed 5 application updates and that took me a little while to figure out as I am not familiar with Chrome OS. But I had it up and working within an hour. I am not a computer wiz. It is amazing to have all my loved apps! Kindle, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu etc. and have laptop capabilities too. Still learning OS. Love the speed. Have so much to learn. This model was a 2017 model. Price was great and Acer Products are amazing. You can never go wrong with Acer. Will update in a month or so.",5 people found this helpful,Yes
