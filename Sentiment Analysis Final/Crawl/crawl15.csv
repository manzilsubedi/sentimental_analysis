You get what you paid for obviously, but not everyone can afford those UHD 4K OLED offerings - which can cost you thousands depending on the brand.With the TCL 4 Series it's more of an introduction than a straightforward future proof alternative to what's available currently on the market, there's still some caveats to consider if you do end up getting this television, the biggest example being the lack of a HDMI 2.1 port, the viewing angle causing saturation depending on where you're looking, or the fact you have to create a Roku account in order to actually use your television to name just a few.So far though everything has been working as intended despite those few gripes, it arrived in perfect condition without any scratches or noticeable defects thankfully. Now granted if you can afford a slightly better TV, you should obviously go that route more than anything. Just keep an open mind about what you're getting into for the price. You won't get the best experience possible out of 4K at this price evidently - but the whole point is to be an affordable entry. And for what it is, it's the best place to start.",254 people found this helpful,Yes

The picture is sharp and clear. I got a independent stand to attach to it so it would fit on my existing TV stand and it works perfectly. It didn't take me long to set the TV up and to update the apps and services I use to it. It gives you 4 HDMI plugs. The biggest downer for me, is that it doesn't work with just any sound bar, and does not work with blue tooth. You have to actually get a sound bar that specifically works with the Roku TV. Also, everytime you turn the TV on, you are brought to the home screen, instead of the last thing you were watching. These two things are so minor and with the price of this TV, I can't find it to be a reason to mark it down. So if you are looking for a TV on a budget, this is a great choice.

Out of concerns for resolution and viewing distance, I actually intended to buy a 32"" TCL screen, and got the 43"" version by accident as a misclick. It turned out to be quite the happy accident, as the extra size and short viewing distance wasn't a problem for me at all when you have true 4K crispness to behold (this is my first true 4K screen, I may be a little biased). It changed the way I use applications too - where before I used to run browsers and programs in fullscreen, now I usually have two things open in vertical panels side-by-side, or even four things open in each corner if I'm really multitasking.As for setup and input selection, like others have said you'll need a Roku account to use it as an actual TV, but you don't to use it as a monitor, and I haven't made one myself. Setup was straightforward, although there was a little bit of complication with display drivers on my Windows computer since it recognizes it as a Generic PnP Monitor and can't quite do the usual crosstalk, but some manual settings resolved those issues. There are a number of display adjustments available, including a ""game mode"" with lower latency (although I'm not entirely sure what that means, since I hardset refresh rate already...) , but more often than not I just adjust the brightness with the remote. The one downside is the lack of physical power or menu buttons on the TV, relying entirely on the remote for control, but it's been reliable for me so far, so as long as that continues to be that case I have no complaints.",14 people found this helpful,Yes

I'm not really sure where those complaints are coming from.  It seems pretty obvious - You're buying a Roku TV... You have to have a Roku account.  Did you really expect you wouldn't have to have some sort of an account?  If you don't want to have to create a Roku account, don't purchase a Roku TV.
