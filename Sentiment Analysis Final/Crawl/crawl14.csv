Can be improved with simple markings.","Pros:- One of the few well built, pro controller only docks out there.- LED isn't freaking blinding/blueCons:- No way to easily align controller, and will probably scratch the port area as you ""fish"" for a connection.- Cord is super short and not removable. Plan to get a good quality A male to A female extension cable if you need a longer run.Other / Simple hack:- I got the idea from enterprise laptop docks to add markings to assist with alignment. One manufacturer has a little dash on the dock and laptop that you line up and something similar dramatically increases the chances of a successful dock on the first try.- I used colored electrical tape to designate the locations of the + and - buttons since the switch logo is hard so see and I didn't want to attach anything or mark on the controller.- If you have she SSB version, the Smash logo makes it REALLY easy since you can add a marking to line up the black space in the middle.- One may also try a paint pen on the dock itself to write/draw markings rather than cutting tape.Ideas/Suggestions to Amazon:- REMOVABLE CABLE PLEASE!! Type C and Micro Usb cables make it dramatically more flexible especially since the attached cable is way too short for any sane use.- If possible use a NON LATCHING type C port like the switch dock uses to reduce force needed to dock and undock.- Possibly add a spring loaded strain relief around port like other controller docks (at least for PS4) and the original switch dock.- Add a notch to the dock and a small, unobtrusive alignment nib that can be adhered to the underside or front (port side) of controller.- Add printed +/- indicators like I have created and maybe a few clear film adhesives with alignment markers that can be adjusted as needed by adhering one on controller and one on dock or several on dock making use of markings on the controller.",7 people found this helpful,Yes
