However, you can easily just restart.I got this because I had no reason to get the PS4 Pro, I don't have a 4K TV nor do I really care about 4K Gaming (and the 6-8 games that are supported for 4K on the Pro.)

I guess it goes without saying it hasn't been great. I had to replace my first PS because the infamous disc-eject issue. I tried everything but it just kept happening. My second PS is this slim edition. So far so good (hasn't broken), but compared to any system I've ever had (maybe beside the NES) it freezes the most, sometimes it just goes extremely slow in menus to the point you almost have to walk away before it's operational. It's also froze a few times without the power button being able to shut it off so you have to unplug, I assume, which has caused corrupted data, which has caused me to have to a reset. Literally the only other person I know with a PS, whom is a close Cousin of mine, has had to replace 2 systems already. We've ranted about how awful our experience has been with the PS4 on more than one occasion being that we've bought 5 systems between two people...for two people.

Honestly, if you'e never done this sort of thing before, skip it. Reading a book, or going for a walk beat this type of entertainment easily. I can see how a child might be captivated by it; but not a fully functional adult.I spent about $200 on a variety of different types of games to see which one was right for me. Just figuring out how the controller works in most games is a deterrent. In any event, once you get the hang of that, ""gaming"" is a bit time consuming. At best, your mind becomes immersed in the game environment, and before long, you notice a few hours have passed. The entertainment value you gain for the hours of investment is mediocre at best. Go to a movie, it's cheaper and sticks with you longer.Now that I've got this thing, I'll continue to use it and explore more games.
