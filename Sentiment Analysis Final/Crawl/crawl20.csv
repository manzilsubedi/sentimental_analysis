They are much better than I was expecting for the price.  They have decent weight to them, they feel really good quality as opposed to the really plastic, light, cheap feel of similar priced products.  The design is sleek, the LEDs are nice, the sound is good quality. You won't obviously get the sound quality of a several-hundred-dollar surround system, but for $16 speakers these are fantastic.  My last set had a constant crackling sound, or a bit of a squeal when they weren't being used (when I left them on but switched to headset). These, thankfully, do not do that.My only criticism would be about how short the cord is between the two speakers.  I wanted to put them on either side of my dual monitor set up (I have 2 27 inch HP pavilions) but the wire connecting the two speakers together isn't quite long enough.  Considering how many people have dual set ups these days I do consider that a design flaw.Otherwise these are excellent little speakers.",478 people found this helpful,Yes

Free blue night-light included,"For the price, you can't beat these little speakers. The sound quality is a lot better than anything I was expecting given the price. They aren't exactly ""bassy"", but they surprisingly have a full, rich sound for their size.  They have two built-in blue leds with a acrylic/plastic diffuser in the base. It looks very cool and modern. IMHO, their design was very well thought out.Sadly, I use these in my office, and also in my bedroom, both of which I keep very dark (think caves, but without the bats). As other have mentioned, the blue leds are very bright. I was thinking of disassembling the speakers and installing a small SPST switch in each one to turn off the leds, but didn't want to destroy them in the process, so I did the simple fix instead. Electrical tape over the leds. If you are Goth/Emo/?, or has a child that is, you can borrow their black fingernail polish and use that instead of tape.Simple procedure, see attached images for directions. Warning: If you do this, you will most likely void the warranty. I apologize for the order of the images here. I tried 3 times, and Amazon randomized the order every time.Cheers!",192 people found this helpful,Yes

I immediately sprung into action, and it led me to this. Based on the mostly positive reviews, I ordered it.""AmazonBasics USB-Powered PC Computer Speakers with Dynamic Sound | Silver"" arrived at my house just the other days. The first thing that struck me is how compact both speakers are (about 4 inches wide, 3 inches high and 3 inches deep) and yet relatively speaking how heavy the set is (about 1.5 lbs), certainly as compared to the previous set of computer speakers. Equally important for someone like me who is the complete opposite of a handy man: how easy is it to install? Turns out to be quite easy: you connect the set's USB cable to the computer's USB slot  and the plug into the headphone jack and away you go. One note of caution: the set's volume control button is in the wire of the left side speaker, and frankly not all that handy. The best solution for that is to turn it way up and leave it there, and then to adjust your computer's volume settings accordingly. So what does is all mean? Well, I have been impressed with the quality of the sounds, as these computer speakers (each being 2W) sound rich and deep.Bottom line: this set of computer speakers is exactly what I was hoping for: easy to install and operate, and sounding very nicely. In other words, this set of computer speakers is exactly as advertised and as written up in the many positive reviews, to which I gladly add my own.

Pretty short wires.,"I just got these, so I cannot attest to their longevity. The speakers are really very nice looking, compact and provide great sound. They are all black except the bottom platform which is silver. The lights at the bottom are pretty bright in a dark room, so if you sleep in the same room and don't turn them off, you may be annoyed until you find a solution (cover/turn off). The wires... The USB power wire and the audio plug wire come from one speaker, we will call it the right speaker, and go to your device. The wire that joins the two speakers together goes from one to the other obviously. We will call that the conjoining wire. The CONJOINING wire is 31 inches long from the back of one speaker to the back of the other, so that is as far apart as they can be from each other. The POWER/AUDIO wire (they run together as one until 6 inches from the device end of the cable) is 44 inches long. That was not an issue for me, so I did not ding it for that, but it is something to consider if you have your hard drive located on the floor or in a remote location. I had to go into my settings for some reason to get these to work with my machine, so if you hook them up and get no sound, try checking your settings before you think the speakers are faulty.
