My gold standard is the Sony MDR-V6, which 30 years ago sold for almost four times the price; today's Sony professional headphones, the best in the business, sell for the expected higher prices.A studio headphone is definitely NOT a headphone made for 'listening' per se. Most consumer headphones for listening have frequency responses tailored to the intended audience. For instance the Beats headphones put out a strong bass (as do many others). Studio headphones must tell the truth; that is, they must have a flat, wide range response with no colorations, no phase distortions, and no intentional emphases. The engineer needs to hear exactly what's going on, exactly as it sounds.Studio headphones also need to be comfortable. If you're sitting offstage recording three hours of opera, the headphones had better not pinch, give headaches, cause sweating, or otherwise irritate and detract attention from a demanding job requiring constant focus.The Amazon studio headphones fail, as studio headphones, on most every count.The bass, while tight and solid, is over-emphasized. The lower mids are murky and the frequency response rolls off so there is no transparency and the barest of high end response. This in turn makes the sound stage narrow and constricted. Fortunately there is no phasiness. But overall the sound is unacceptably inaccurate, and not even especially pleasant, over a wide variety of source material.Comfort is not good, either. The headphones are way too tight and give an instant headache. The top bar is not padded on the underside and feels like a hard object pressing into the top of your head, which is exactly what it is. THe headphones are also hot. I couldn't imagine using these over the course of a multi-hour performance. I will say that the acoustic isolation is excellent.The headphones are supplied with a coiled cord that extends nicely, and a quarter inch adapter for the eighth inch plug.But for the price, would you really expect to get good studio monitor headphones? I certainly wouldn't. And in fact, you don't. These might not be bad for listening to some music on a casual basis, but if you use them in a professional setting, you're risking your reputation and maybe your career.",280 people found this helpful,No

They're my favorite headphones I've ever owned. They're over the ear, loud, and comfortable. However, the vinyl was deteriorating. I had to replace them.I originally placed an order for another set of headphones, from a third party seller. They were $60 and offered a $15 off coupon discount and an additional promo code, knocking the headphones down to $15. However, the third party seller didn't want to honor the new price. I was a little bit upset. Why release promo codes and coupons, and then not honor them? Those headphones are still in stock, by the way.I was looking for an alternative. Something similar to my beloved SkullCandy Hesh 2 headphones, basically.These headphones popped up, underneath a section on the Home Page, of items similar to those I've recently viewed. I've never even heard of Amazon Basics. But for $20, I figured trying them out wouldn't hurt. If I didn't like them, I could always return them.My expectations were low, but these headphones are incredible. The audio quality is amazing (Crystal clear and loud.), they're comfortable, they're over the ear style, and they arrived in 1 business day. For $20, they're a great purchase.Keep in mind : I've never used top of the line DJ style headphones (Beats, for example.), but I'm sure these aren't comparable to those. But if you just want to listen to music on your phone or laptop, these Amazon Basics headphones are perfect. And all I wanted was to listen to music on my phone.I'm very pleased with this purchase.",6 people found this helpful,Yes

I find these to be quite comfortable, and the fact that they come with two detachable cords is a real plus.
