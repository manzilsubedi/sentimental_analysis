Not bassy. Excellent mids and highs, solid lows.","I've tried a ton of headphones lately and these sound by far the best to me. I like generally flat sound. I'm more concerned with clear mids and highs and want present but not overpowering bass and low bass.Headphones I've tried include the following with my totally subjective sound rating on 10 point scale. YMMV.Audio Technica ATH-M50X - highs a little subdued for my liking - 7Beats Studio 2 Wireless - Subdued highs, some mid bass emphasis but not overpowering. 6Bose QC25 - A little weak on bass and weak on highs, best ANC. 7Bose QC35 - Can be a little bassy, especially at low volume. Bright highs. Best ANC. 9JBL - EVEREST 700 - Way too bassy. 5.JBL - Everest Elite 700 - Much better than non-Elite, 7OPPO PM-3 - Excellent, expensive. 10Sennheiser 202 - yuck. Too bassy, no highs, but cheap. 4Sennheiser 280 - well balanced. 8Sennheiser Momentum M2 - Close to perfection. 9.5Sennheiser PXC-550 - wireless noise cancelling. These are excellent. 9Sony - MDRXB950BT/B - Extra bass says it all. 4Sony 7506 - Perfection 10Out of all that I've tried the Sony 7506 are closest to perfection, to live performance. They are not bass heavy at all but can produce comfortable solid bass down to quite low frequencies. Tonal balance leans towards the upper mids and highs. Bright but not harsh. You end up hearing subtle sounds in the music that is missing with other headphones. Those who want more bass or don't want bright highs won't like these. But for my listening taste this matches perfectly.They are also very comfortable. Many of the headphones listed above are not as comfortable. Either tight band or thin band or ear cups that aren't big or deep enough. These headphones are great. Biggest disadvantage vs. many that I've tried recently is that these are wired... with a long heavy cord easy to get caught on things. I was looking for a wireless headphone. But ultimately I couldn't find one at a reasonable price that sounded anywhere near as good as these. Next closest was the Sennheiser PXC-550, but at $400, wireless wasn't worth an extra $320. I also found that there were times I didn't want noise cancellation. Too bad Sony doesn't make a wireless headphone with anywhere near this sound.Best of all, these are by far the cheapest of the decent sounding headphones I've listened to.  The headphones in this list range in prices from $20 to $450.Highly recommend the Sony 7506... if you like this sort of sound signature.","1,065 people found this helpful",Yes

They are excellent, studio quality headphones. If you plan to wear them out and about though (like the NYC commuter I am) they effectively also serve as earmuffs. That's all well and good in winter, but on the June day I wore them out, I was sweating out the top of my head and down my neck. Amazing sound quality, but not great for being out in the heat. In their defense, these headphones never made that claim. They never made any claims at all, as they are an inanimate object without speech capability.

They sound fantastic yet natural and their ear-pads assure virtually no sound monitor leakage at loud volumes.  Under rugged pro use, a pair of 7506s last a decade or so unless you yank the cord out or step on them.  One caveat, however - an issue which Sony has never rectified - is that these headphones will painfully pinch the web between your thumb and forefinger while placing them on your head due to a surprisingly sharp articulation in the joint that holds the earpieces to the headband.  A simple fix is to wrap black electrical tape around the articulation, which really isn't needed to optimally adjust their fit - the articulation has no purpose other than to make them ""collapsable.""  Walk into any major market radio station that supplies them to its jocks & producers and you'll probably notice that the chief engineer has already taped the joint open.  For my taste in pro audio, though, the sound and durability of these headphones far, far outweighs the pinch potential, and, for the bucks, you can't get a better pro headphone.",135 people found this helpful,Yes

You will not be disappointed! Just know what you're buying....,"I've owned these for just over 6 months now, and while I wanted to write a review the second I first listened to them, I decided to wait. That being said....WOW. For the price, or even not for the price, these are the single best headphones not only that I've owned but that I've ever listened to. That includes the very high-end cans on sample at Brookstone, Best Buy, etc. Of course, I am not a seasoned audiophile but I know when something sounds good. These sound GREAT. There are pros and cons though:Pros:The sound. The glorious, clear, nuanced sound. Just amazing, and if you've always wondered how music is supposed to sound, these are your new headphones. There is a reason these are used in studios by professionals and have been for over 20 years (in which time, the design of the headphones has never changed!). There is no bias in the sound profile, just balance and clarity like nothing you've ever heard before.The sound.The sound.Noise-cancellation. These are not actually designed for it. but given that they are pretty impressive. I usually have them driven pretty hard and turned up to a decent volume. but that's how they're meant to be used and they do not disappoint or let in anything you don't want to bother you.Comfort. Very nice, don't grab my head too hard, I can wear them for an hour or more before giving my ears a short break.The cord. I play guitar, and I can stand and move around without any worry because the cord is very long and allows a lot of freedom.The price. I paid around $80 for these and they far outperform anything I've ever owned, which includes Beats by Dre and others.Cons:The cord. These are sit-at-home headphones. I mean, do as you please, but personally I wouldn't be walking around or using these as everyday headphones. At around 10' long and coiled, it isn't as convenient as some.The bass. If you're a bass junkie, I'm sorry but you will be disappointed. These are meant to deliver a perfect sound profile, the one intended by the original producer. Even then, on dubstep songs and such, the bass falls flat. Not a big deal to me, even though I love bassy songs, because these are so impressive in other regards that I can deal with the lack of power. They do, however, have extremely quick, punchy, satisfying response throughout the audio range and that includes bass....they just lack the power of headphones like Beats and such which are designed for bass.Overall, just get them. Worth every penny. I use them for studying, playing guitar, watching movies, listening to high-quality audio, etc. and they are always impressive to me. It is actually fun to listen to things with them because everything sounds so good! Everything you've heard on headphone forums and favorable reviews is true, they really are impressive.",106 people found this helpful,Yes

Impeccable neutrality, outstanding comfort, and timeless build quality soon made them an industry standard. Today is January 2, 2016. And yes, 25 years later they remain by far the go to headphones of audio pros everywhere. They were high resolution before there was high resolution, Hi Res. The Sony MDR7506 is a true classic. They are great for all genres of music but they will not fake it. If the source ain't good, then the source will not sound good. But if the source is good, then the sound will be just as good. Lead vocals and lead guitars will take their place at center stage. Everything will be in its place the way the artists and engineers wanted it. And everything will be heard. Great music comes into full bloom. Hallelujah!If I only had two pairs of headphones for listening to music and watching movies at home one would be a Closed and the other an Open back headphone. Though I prefer the open to the closed ""sound "" in general there is a time and a place for both. And sometimes my ears just get stale and need a change. All open and no closed makes Butch have dull ears... For its vivid clarity, wide soundstage, and outstanding comfort my Open choice would be a pair of Sennheiser HD600 Open Back Professional headphones. Check! Nothing less than $400 is as good. For my closed headphone there is none as good as the Sony MDR 7506 for less than $150. Check! Not even the Audio-Technica ATH M50/50X. Yes, they can be a fun headphone to listen to. But they do not ever offer a full bloom due to their Bass bias. All equalization does is further degrade the source's sound. With neutral cans I decide if and where I want any bumps not someone else...  At 10 Oz's the M50's are a full 2 Oz's heavier and over the long haul not as comfortable as the 7506's. Nor are they as durable. Don't get me wrong, I love the ATH M50's from time to time, but they are not the headphone the 7506's are. In addition to home use I would add that the 7506 are also very portable. The coiled cable has been designed so as not to want to get tangled up with itself like so many other coiled cables. These Sony's are fully engineered. Professional indeed. Very minimalist down to their flat black finish. Very Zen.",79 people found this helpful,Yes

The overall sound of these are very balanced. This means the Low, Medium, and high tones are for the most part balanced out. You can easily look up a lot of information on these headphones. They are an industry standard which I have enjoyed owning for more than two years now.The overall design of the headphones is fairly good. They are structurally well designed for the most part.- Noise isolation is mediocre. You can hear people saying things through these depending on the volume.- Sound leakage on the original pads is fairly low. People won't have to hear your music when it is at a fairly loud volume.- Extremely long, coiled cable with 1/4-inch adapter. Possibly gold connections.- Sturdy cable design. Each cable bend point is reinforced with additional rubber. Soldering to the driver seems sturdy as well, it should be able to withstand most tugs. This is usually not an issue with the gargantuan coiled cable. The coiled cable also prevents a large number of tangles!- The headband is fairly comfortable. You could easily find a cover for it if it becomes a problem.- Cup adjustment pieces have numbers on them to ensure a specific setting.The problems I've had with these over time:- Headband will lose its tension between your ears over time. These headphones no longer fit as soundly on my head as they used to.- Faux leather pads will need to be replaced. I have included a picture of both of my ripped pads which I replaced with ""Beyerdynamic EDT250V Headphone Ear Pads Black"" these will create some additional noise leakage.- The wire that connects the drivers to the headband can get stuck in the housing. (see picture) This may wear the wire a bit.- Cable is extremely long. This can be an issue when you want to use these headphones outside of their intended purpose. The cable is generally a bit heavy, causing strain to the connections. I very often have to move it around to have it stop bothering me. The cable can be replaced with some soldering. There have been projects modifying the headphones to have a detachable cable. Google ""Sony MDR-7506 Detachable Cable Mod"" that I believe would improve the design of the headphones.- Like all over the ear headphones, these will be uncomfortable with glasses. They do become very uncomfortable after a few hours.- While these do come with a transport bag, even the fold up design makes them a bit of a pain to transport. This is to be expected.- Fold up design doesn't center the cups when the length of each ear cup is at minimum. (See picture) Not sure what this does to the longevity of the headband.- The blue portion of the ""Professional"" stickers on the sides are decals. One of mine peeled off. It looks similar, but is starting to disappear, and collects dust. (see picture)Aside from a few gripes, these are still my favorite set of headphones. They simply sound right. I was appalled to go to the store and listen to some Bose headphones and hear how bad the quality was in comparison: for a set of $300 headphones.These are undoubtedly worth the price.

I wouldn't recommend them to anyone for that matter. Choose another brand. These also aren't made very sturdy and have a wire that looks like it will break any day now.

They DOemphasize the mids in music which is the sweet spot in listening dueto a person actually wanting to hear ""voices"". The soundstage isexpansive and detail oriented so you ""really hear"" the backgroundsin the music.  You want this in your headphones because it givesyou more of a sonic experience.

The reviews saying they don't sound that good, probably bought them for the wrong reasons. These are meant for audio production, mixing and mastering.Anyway,I've had these for 10 years now. Aside from the accolades detailed in the other reviews, I'd like to mention the repairs that are capable of being practiced to squeeze a few more years out of your favorite cans.I have replaced the foam cups twice. You can find these on eBay and Amazon for very cheap.The wire in the headband and the external coil cable failed about 7 years into ownership. I replaced both with some inventive repairs. (Note the drilled holes for the wire and ziptie anchors)All wiring has been replaced and I installed a 3.5mm jack so I can replace the external cord whenever I want.The drivers started to crackle at the 10 year mark. I reflowed all the solder connections and pinned the driver in place (internally) with a dab of hot glue. This will reduce any physical vibration.If you want to get the extra mileage out of these you absolutely can. Wonderful headphones.

But they were unbearable to wear. For those with pain, it seems there is a guy on YouTube who found a fix for ear pain on the MDR-7506. Just insert a piece of rope into the inner lining of the OEM headphone pads, between the foam covering the speaker and the donut-like ear pad itself.I tried this method using just a thin strip of rolled-up T-shirt cloth and it works. Now I have no pain at all.Search on YouTube for ""How to make thicker, more comfortable ear pads for Sony MDR-7506 Headphones"" to see exactly how he does it.",8 people found this helpful,Yes

Over the years, working as an audio engineer,  I auditioned many headphones and settled on the Sony MDR7506 because they exhibited clarity at the high end while maintaining a solid bass.  I later added a stereo 1/3 octave equalizer and used a precision test tone CD to calibrate my listening station to match my aging hearing.  The results were outstanding!  I enjoyed hearing sounds again that I'd been missing (small metal percussion instruments, acoustic string overtones, speech sibilance, etc.).I recently acquired a $500 pair of ""audiophile"" headphones and compared them with my old Sony.  My first reaction was physical discomfort resulting from the weight and unpleasant earphone cushions that surrounded my ears, rather than resting on them.  After equalizing them, I was surprised to find that, to my ears, they did not sound as good as the Sony.  Perhaps for someone with ""normal hearing"", the smoother frequency response of these expensive headphones is desirable.  For me, I'll stay with the Sony MDR7506 for their light weight, comfort and clarity.Not long ago I gave away my first pair of the Sony MDR7506 and held on to the pair I've had for 10 years.  I decided it was time to celebrate the results of my recent listening comparisons, and ordered a new pair.  I was happy to see that the design and construction remain unchanged, and remarkably, the amount of equalization required is the same as my 10 year old pair!I gave away the $500 headphones.If you're looking for comfort & clarity...check out the now classic...Sony MDR7506 headphones!  And if you want to take them to the next level...add a 1/3 octave stereo equalizer (that can be set by ear or more ""scientifically"" with a precision test tone CD (or other source).",7 people found this helpful,Yes

Feels like quality. Unfortunately it goes downhill from there.These are the harshest, most terribly balanced headphones I've ever heard in my life. Simply put: the lower treble range is overemphasized by many magnitudes and it's impossible to correct with EQ. If you listen at the lowest possible setting your equipment can provide, it might be ok for monitoring a video or something. If you are mixing with this it is going to sound dull on anything else, because you probably tried to bring down the icepick highs with EQ. I really wanted to like this headphone because of the build quality, but it's actually painful to listen to.If you want a decent sounding closed back headphone, spend a little more and get a pair of DT770's.

Had been using a set of 1970's Pioneer SE-305 headphones which sounded great but were a bit heavy. These Sony's were recommended by a review I read online.  When I first listened to the piano through them, I thought I must be imagining how poor the sound was, so I took them to a friend's studio, where he ran his own comparison test: (a) AKG professional studio monitor headphones (b) these Sony phones and (c) the old-school Pioneer phones, all with a high-end Yamaha DP set to ""Grand"". The Pioneers were nearly  as good as the AKG's -- flat sound true to the keyboard.  The Sony headphones' sound was far inferior to the old Pioneers -- harsh mid- and high-notes, and mushy/muffled lows.  They will be returned and I'll live with the weight of the oldies.",12 people found this helpful,Yes

I think the price (I paid $79.99) is more than fair for the performance you get. I mean my Jaybird X3's cost $20 more and sound like crap in comparison. Currently I mostly use my LG V40 for playing tracks I have ripped from CD'S in FLAC format, and the LG phones have an excellent DAC for a cell phone. The downside is that you need to use the 3.5mm plug, but that's where these come in. I was worried that the phone would not be able to drive these to acceptable volume levels, but with my phone it's fine, I never get above 80% of max volume.The sound is even and well balanced, bass is not boomy or sloppy, unless it is on the track. They do a great job of reproducing faithfully what the audio engineer wanted you to hear. Some recordings are obviously better than others, so a crappy recording (Collective Soul for instance) really highlight how poorly the music is presented. Really great music is just so much more interesting to listen to with these headphones.If they break I will buy them again without hesitation. 5 stars.",5 people found this helpful,Yes

(Updated Review),"These are garbage, and here's why. So, I purchased these a while back as studio monitors. These were the ONLY headphones I ever used, so I thought they were perfection. I always wondered why, when I listed to my compositions elsewhere, the low end never sounded like it did in my headphones. I just figured, I needed time to perfect my art.Then, one day, not too long ago, I put in some cheap earbuds (because these hurt my top part of my ear)--I lived with it because I thought these were perfection. Anyway, so, I mixed down a song I made using my earbuds, and I listen to my songs in the car, home stereo, walkman--lol, not that old, and other family house radios. My mixdown from my earbuds sounded perfection!I was like, what?. I put on these ""Professional...blah, blah, blah"" and noticed that the low end was messed up compared to my earbuds and every other speaker on Earth! Yep, it took all this time for me to notice that it wasn't me, it was these GARBAGE HEADPHONES and their is not a darn thing I can do because I WAY passed my return date.OMG, what a waste of time, money, and grief--thinking it was my poor ability to mixdown correctly.Stay Away from this garbage!What a waste......this is one of those live and learn things for me.",17 people found this helpful,Yes

In fact, it is the sound quality that inched it up to 4 stars instead of 3. I played around with many different brands at local music shops and such and frankly, these were on par with everything but the most expensive as far as sound quality.Now for the dis: As with most headphones of this style, they do not let your ears breath so wearing them for prolonged periods (more than 30 mins.) means you are going to sweat in them, possibly a lot. Sweat breaks down electronics as well as ear-pads (not to mention being uncomfortable). The other one that almost put these in the 3 star territory is the obnoxiously heavy cord. From using them on an electric piano to smart phone to portable guitar amp, the cord is constantly in the way and constantly a pain. I realize this is a problem for all corded electronics to some extent, but this thing is heavy so no matter how you position it, gravity does it's thing in short order and it is pulling on the input jack of your device (premature wear) as well as the headphones (wrapping tight against your neck and causing a lot of strain on the point where the cord goes into the headphones which means this will eventually pull out and fail).All in all, they are nice and I like them, just be prepared to fuss with the cord a lot or come up with a way to clip it to your clothes or something because it'll drive you nuts.",6 people found this helpful,Yes
